# UNIT - 6: Semiconductor Physics

### 1. Energy Bands in Solids

- Atoms have discrete energy levels; in solids, these levels broaden into **energy bands** due to interaction between atoms.
- Two main bands:
  - **Valence Band:** Occupied by electrons.
  - **Conduction Band:** Electrons here can move freely and conduct electricity.
- The gap between these bands is the **energy band gap (Eg)**.
- Materials are classified by Eg:
  - **Insulator:** Large Eg (>4 eV), no free electrons.
  - **Semiconductor:** Moderate Eg (~1-2 eV).
  - **Conductor:** Overlapping bands or zero Eg.

### 2. Types of Materials

| Material     | Band Gap (Eg)      | Conductivity        |
|--------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Insulator    | Large (>4 eV)      | Very low            |
| Semiconductor| Moderate (~1-2 eV) | Moderate            |
| Conductor    | Zero or overlap    | Very high           |

### 3. Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors

- **Intrinsic:** Pure semiconductor; electrons excited thermally create equal electrons and holes.
- **Extrinsic:** Doped semiconductor.
  - **n-type:** Doped with pentavalent impurity → excess electrons.
  - **p-type:** Doped with trivalent impurity → excess holes.

### 4. p-n Junction

- Formed by joining p-type and n-type semiconductors.
- At junction, electrons and holes recombine forming a **depletion region** with a potential barrier.
- Acts as a diode allowing current mostly in one direction.

---

### 5. Junction Diode and V-I Characteristics

- A diode is a p-n junction device.
- **Forward Bias:** Positive voltage to p-side reduces barrier, current flows after threshold (~0.7 V for Si).
- **Reverse Bias:** Positive voltage to n-side increases barrier, current very small (reverse saturation current).

### 6. Types of Junction Diodes

- **p-n Junction Diode:** Basic rectifying diode.
- **Zener Diode:** Allows current in reverse after breakdown; used for voltage regulation.
- **LED:** Emits light under forward bias.
- **Photodiode:** Generates current when illuminated.

### 7. Diode as Rectifier

- **Half Wave Rectifier:** Single diode passes only one half of AC waveform.
- **Full Wave Rectifier (Centre Tapped):** Two diodes and center-tapped transformer allow both halves of AC waveform to pass as pulsating DC.

### 8. Transistor

- A semiconductor device with **three terminals**: Emitter (E), Base (B), Collector (C).
- Types:
  - **pnp transistor:** p-type emitter and collector, n-type base.
  - **npn transistor:** n-type emitter and collector, p-type base.
- Used for amplification and switching.
