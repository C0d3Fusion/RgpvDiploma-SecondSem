### 1. Lasers

- **Energy Levels:** Atoms have discrete energy levels; electrons can move between these by absorbing or emitting energy.
- **Ionization Potential:** Energy required to remove an electron from an atom.
- **Excitation Potential:** Energy required to move an electron from ground state to an excited state.

#### Emission Types:
- **Spontaneous Emission:** Electron in excited state falls randomly to lower energy level emitting photon.
- **Stimulated Emission:** An incoming photon stimulates an excited electron to drop to lower energy level, emitting a coherent photon (same phase, frequency, direction).

#### Population Inversion:
- Condition where more atoms are in excited state than ground state; essential for laser action.

#### Pumping Methods:
- Energy supplied to achieve population inversion.
- Types: Optical pumping (using light), electrical pumping, chemical pumping.

#### Optical Feedback:
- Using mirrors in laser cavity to reflect light back and forth to amplify it.

#### Types of Lasers:
- **Ruby Laser:** Solid-state, uses chromium ions in ruby crystal.
- **He-Ne Laser:** Gas laser using helium and neon gases.
- **Semiconductor Laser:** Uses p-n junction diode emitting coherent light.

#### Laser Characteristics:
- Monochromatic (single wavelength)
- Coherent (waves in phase)
- Directional (narrow beam)
- High intensity

#### Applications of Lasers:
- **Engineering:** Cutting, welding, material processing.
- **Medical:** Eye surgery, skin treatments, dental procedures.

### 2. Fiber Optics

#### Introduction:
- Optical fibers are thin, flexible fibers made of glass or plastic that transmit light signals over long distances.

#### Light Propagation:
- Light travels inside the fiber by **total internal reflection** within the core.

#### Acceptance Angle (θₐ):
- Maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still be guided inside.

#### Numerical Aperture (NA):
- Measure of light acceptance by the fiber.
- Formula:  
  **NA = sin θₐ = √(n₁² - n₂²)**  
  where n₁ = refractive index of core, n₂ = refractive index of cladding.

#### Fiber Types:
- **Single Mode Fiber:** Small core diameter; transmits single light mode.
- **Multi Mode Fiber:** Larger core; multiple light modes.

#### Applications:
- Telecommunication: High-speed data transmission.
- Medical: Endoscopy.
- Sensors: Temperature, pressure sensing.
