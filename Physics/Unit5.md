### 1. Types of Magnetic Materials

Magnetic materials are classified based on their response to an external magnetic field into three main types:

#### a) Diamagnetic Materials
- These materials create an induced magnetic field in a direction **opposite** to the applied magnetic field.
- They are **weakly repelled** by a magnet.
- Examples: Bismuth, Copper, Silver, Gold.
- **Property:** Negative magnetic susceptibility (χ < 0).
- When the external magnetic field is removed, diamagnetism disappears.
  
#### b) Paramagnetic Materials
- These materials create an induced magnetic field in the **same direction** as the applied magnetic field.
- They are **weakly attracted** by a magnet.
- Examples: Aluminum, Platinum, Magnesium.
- **Property:** Positive magnetic susceptibility (χ > 0) but small.
- Magnetism disappears once the external field is removed.
  
#### c) Ferromagnetic Materials
- These materials are **strongly attracted** by a magnet and can be permanently magnetized.
- Examples: Iron, Cobalt, Nickel.
- They have **domains** where magnetic moments are aligned.
- Show **hysteresis** behavior (magnetization remains even after removing the external field).
- Magnetic susceptibility is very large and positive.

### 2. Magnetic Field and its Units

- The **magnetic field** at any point is defined as the force experienced per unit magnetic pole placed at that point.
- Denoted by **B** or **magnetic flux density**.
- Unit: Tesla (T) in SI, where 1 Tesla = 1 Weber/m².
- 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss (CGS unit).

---

### 3. Magnetic Intensity (H)

- Also called **magnetic field strength**.
- Defined as the magnetizing force applied to a magnetic material.
- Related to magnetic field B and magnetization M by the equation:
  
  **B = μ₀ (H + M)**
  
  where,  
  - B = Magnetic flux density (Tesla),  
  - H = Magnetic intensity (A/m),  
  - M = Magnetization (A/m),  
  - μ₀ = Permeability of free space = 4π × 10⁻⁷ T·m/A.
  
- Unit of H: Ampere per meter (A/m).

### 4. Magnetic Lines of Force

- Imaginary lines representing the direction and strength of the magnetic field.
- Characteristics:
  - They start from the **north pole** and end at the **south pole**.
  - They never intersect.
  - The density of lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field.
  - Always form closed loops inside a magnet.

---

### 5. Magnetic Flux and its Units

- **Magnetic flux (Φ)** is the total magnetic field (B) passing through a given area (A).
- Formula:

  **Φ = B × A × cosθ**
  
  where,  
  - Φ = magnetic flux (Weber, Wb),  
  - B = magnetic flux density (Tesla, T),  
  - A = area (m²),  
  - θ = angle between magnetic field and normal to the surface.
  
- Unit of magnetic flux: Weber (Wb).  
- 1 Weber = 1 Tesla × 1 m².

### 6. Magnetization (M)

- Magnetization is the magnetic moment per unit volume of a material.
- Represents how strongly a material is magnetized.
- Defined as:

  **M = magnetic moment / volume**

- Unit: A/m (Ampere per meter).
- Related to magnetic intensity H and magnetic susceptibility χ by:

  **M = χ × H**

### 7. Concept of Electromagnetic Induction

- When there is a **change in magnetic flux** linked with a coil or conductor, an **emf (electromotive force)** is induced in it.
- This phenomenon is called **electromagnetic induction**.
- Discovered by Michael Faraday.

---

### 8. Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction

- **First Law:** Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a coil changes, an emf is induced in the coil.
- **Second Law:** The magnitude of induced emf is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.

Mathematically,

**e = -dΦ/dt**

where,  
- e = induced emf (Volt),  
- Φ = magnetic flux (Weber),  
- t = time (seconds).

The negative sign indicates the direction of emf (Lenz's Law).

### 9. Lorentz Force (Force on Moving Charge in Magnetic Field)

- A charged particle q moving with velocity **v** in a magnetic field **B** experiences a force **F** given by:

  **F = q (v × B)**

- Direction of force is perpendicular to both velocity and magnetic field (right-hand rule).
- Magnitude:

  **F = q v B sinθ**

where θ is the angle between velocity vector and magnetic field.

---

### 10. Force on Current Carrying Conductor in Magnetic Field

- When a current-carrying conductor of length **L** is placed in a magnetic field **B**, it experiences a force:

  **F = I L × B**

where,  
- I = current (Ampere),  
- L = length vector of conductor in the magnetic field,  
- B = magnetic flux density (Tesla).

- Magnitude of force:

  **F = I L B sinθ**

where θ is the angle between conductor and magnetic field.

---

### 11. Force on Rectangular Coil Placed in Magnetic Field

- A rectangular coil with N turns, carrying current I, placed in a uniform magnetic field B experiences torque τ.

- If coil has dimensions length l and breadth b, and is placed such that the plane of coil makes an angle θ with B, then:

  **Torque, τ = N I A B sinθ**

where,  
- A = area of the coil = l × b.

- The coil tends to align itself with the magnetic field.

### 12. Moving Coil Galvanometer

#### Principle:
- A current-carrying coil placed in a magnetic field experiences a torque.
- This torque causes the coil to rotate against a restoring torque of a spring or suspension wire.
- The angular deflection is proportional to the current passing through the coil.

#### Construction:
- A rectangular coil of many turns is wound on a light frame.
- The coil is suspended between the poles of a strong permanent magnet.
- The coil is connected to a pointer which moves over a calibrated scale.
- A restoring spring or suspension wire provides the restoring torque.

#### Working:
- When current flows through the coil, it experiences a torque in the magnetic field, causing it to rotate.
- The pointer attached to the coil deflects by an angle θ proportional to the current.
- The restoring torque from the spring balances the magnetic torque at equilibrium.

### 13. Conversion of Galvanometer into Ammeter and Voltmeter

- **Galvanometer to Ammeter:**
  - A low resistance called **shunt resistance (Rs)** is connected in parallel with the galvanometer.
  - It allows most of the current to bypass the galvanometer, protecting it.
  - The ammeter can measure large currents.

- **Galvanometer to Voltmeter:**
  - A high resistance called **series resistance (Rser)** is connected in series with the galvanometer.
  - It limits the current passing through the galvanometer.
  - The voltmeter can measure high voltages.
