# UNIT 3: Electrostatics

Electrostatics is the branch of physics that deals with electric charges at rest. It explains how charges interact, produce electric fields, and how electric potentials and capacitors work.

## 1. Coulomb’s Law

**Coulomb’s Law** gives the force between two point charges:

**Formula:**

    F = (k * q1 * q2) / r²

Where:  
- `F` = Electrostatic force between charges (in Newton)  
- `q1` and `q2` = Amounts of two charges (in Coulombs)  
- `r` = Distance between the charges (in meters)  
- `k` = Coulomb’s constant = 9 × 10⁹ Nm²/C²

This law shows that:
- Force is directly proportional to product of charges.
- Inversely proportional to square of distance between them.

## 2. Unit of Charge

The SI unit of charge is **Coulomb (C)**.  
1 Coulomb is the charge transferred in 1 second by a current of 1 Ampere.

---

## 3. Electric Field (E)

The **Electric Field** at a point is defined as the force per unit positive test charge placed at that point.

**Formula:**

    E = F / q

Where:  
- `E` = Electric field (N/C)  
- `F` = Force experienced  
- `q` = Test charge

---

## 4. Electric Lines of Force

Electric field lines represent the direction of the electric field. Properties:
- Start from positive and end at negative charge.
- Never intersect.
- Denser lines = stronger field.
- Tangent to a line gives field direction.

---

## 5. Electric Flux (Φ)

Electric flux measures the number of electric field lines passing through a surface.

**Formula:**

    Φ = E × A × cosθ

Where:  
- `Φ` = Electric flux (Nm²/C)  
- `E` = Electric field  
- `A` = Area  
- `θ` = Angle between E and normal to surface

---

## 6. Electric Potential (V)

**Electric Potential** at a point is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point.

**Formula:**

    V = W / q

Where:  
- `V` = Electric potential (Volt)  
- `W` = Work done (Joule)  
- `q` = Charge (Coulomb)

---

## 7. Potential Difference

It is the difference in electric potential between two points.

**Formula:**

    V = IR

Where:  
- `V` = Potential difference (Volt)  
- `I` = Current (Ampere)  
- `R` = Resistance (Ohm)

---

## 8. Gauss’s Law

Gauss's Law relates the electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed.

**Formula:**

    ∮E · dA = q / ε₀

Where:  
- `E` = Electric field  
- `dA` = Small area element  
- `q` = Total charge enclosed  
- `ε₀` = Permittivity of free space = 8.85 × 10⁻¹² C²/N·m²

---

## Applications of Gauss’s Law

### a. Electric Field Due to an Infinite Line of Charge

**Formula:**

    E = (λ) / (2πε₀r)

Where:  
- `λ` = Linear charge density  
- `r` = Distance from the wire

### b. Electric Field Due to an Infinite Plane Sheet

**Formula:**

    E = σ / (2ε₀)

Where:  
- `σ` = Surface charge density

### c. Electric Field Due to a Charged Sphere

- **Outside the sphere:**  
  E = (1 / (4πε₀)) × (q / r²)

- **On the surface:**  
  Same as above with `r = radius`

- **Inside the sphere:**  
  E = 0 (for conductor)

## 9. Capacitor

A **capacitor** stores electric charge and energy.

- **Working Principle**: Two conductors separated by an insulator (dielectric).
- **Unit**: Farad (F)

---

## 10. Capacitance (C)

It is the ability of a capacitor to store charge.

**Formula:**

    C = q / V

Where:  
- `C` = Capacitance  
- `q` = Charge stored  
- `V` = Potential difference

---

## 11. Types of Capacitors

- Parallel Plate Capacitor
- Cylindrical Capacitor
- Spherical Capacitor
- Variable Capacitor

---

## 12. Capacitance of Parallel Plate Capacitor

**Formula:**

    C = (ε₀ * A) / d

Where:  
- `A` = Area of plates  
- `d` = Distance between plates  
- `ε₀` = Permittivity of free space

---

## 13. Effect of Dielectric

When a dielectric is inserted between plates:

**Formula:**

    C = (K * ε₀ * A) / d

Where:  
- `K` = Dielectric constant (>1)

**Dielectric Increases Capacitance.**

---

## 14. Dielectric Breakdown

When a dielectric is subjected to a very high electric field, it loses insulating property and starts conducting. This is called **dielectric breakdown**.

---

## 15. Combination of Capacitors

### a. **Series Combination**

    1 / C_total = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃ + ...

### b. **Parallel Combination**

    C_total = C₁ + C₂ + C₃ + ...

---

## 16. Numericals (Conceptual Practice)

- Calculate electric field at a point due to a line charge.
- Find capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor with air and with dielectric.
- Determine equivalent capacitance in series and parallel combinations.
