# UNIT 2: Optics

## 1. Basic Optical Laws

### 🔹 Law of Reflection
- The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
- Both the incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal lie in the same plane.

### 🔹 Law of Refraction (Snell's Law)
- When light passes from one medium to another, it bends (refracts).
- **Snell's Law Formula:**  
  `n₁ × sin(i) = n₂ × sin(r)`

  Where:  
  - `n₁` = refractive index of first medium  
  - `n₂` = refractive index of second medium  
  - `i` = angle of incidence  
  - `r` = angle of refraction  

---

## 2. Refractive Index

### 🔹 Definition:
It tells how much the speed of light is reduced in a medium compared to vacuum.

### 🔹 Formula:  
`Refractive Index (n) = Speed of Light in Vacuum (c) / Speed of Light in Medium (v)`

Or,  
`n = sin(i) / sin(r)`

Where:  
- `c ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s`

## 3. Image Formation by Mirrors

### 🔹 Concave Mirror
- Can form real and inverted images or virtual and magnified images depending on the object position.

### 🔹 Convex Mirror
- Always forms virtual, erect, and diminished images.

---

## 4. Image Formation by Lenses

### 🔹 Convex Lens (Converging Lens)
- Forms real, inverted images if object is beyond the focal point.
- Forms virtual, magnified images if object is between lens and focus.

### 🔹 Concave Lens (Diverging Lens)
- Always forms virtual, erect, and diminished images.

---

## 5. Thin Lens Formula

### 🔹 Formula:  
`1/f = 1/v - 1/u`

Where:  
- `f` = focal length of the lens  
- `v` = image distance from lens  
- `u` = object distance from lens  

*(Sign convention must be used properly)*

---

## 6. Power of a Lens

### 🔹 Definition:
The power of a lens indicates its ability to bend light.

### 🔹 Formula:  
`P = 100 / f`

Where:  
- `P` = Power in dioptres (D)  
- `f` = focal length in centimeters (cm)

---

## 7. Magnification

### 🔹 Formula:  
`Magnification (M) = Height of Image / Height of Object = v / u`

- For mirrors and lenses, `M` tells how much larger or smaller the image is compared to the object.

---

## 8. Total Internal Reflection (TIR)

### 🔹 Definition:
When a light ray passes from a denser medium to a rarer medium at an angle greater than the critical angle, it reflects back entirely into the denser medium.

### 🔹 Conditions for TIR:
1. Light must travel from denser to rarer medium.
2. Angle of incidence must be greater than the critical angle.

### 🔹 Critical Angle:
The angle of incidence at which the angle of refraction becomes 90°.

### 🔹 Formula:  
`sin(C) = n₂ / n₁`

Where:  
- `C` = critical angle  
- `n₁` = refractive index of denser medium  
- `n₂` = refractive index of rarer medium

---

## 9. Applications of TIR

- **Optical Fibers**
- Diamonds' sparkle
- Mirage formation
- Prism reflectors in binoculars

---

## 10. Optical Fibers

### 🔹 Definition:
An optical fiber is a thin, flexible strand of glass or plastic that carries light using total internal reflection.

### 🔹 Structure:
- **Core:** Inner part, where light travels
- **Cladding:** Outer layer with lower refractive index
- **Jacket:** Protective outer layer

### 🔹 Working:
Light entering the fiber undergoes repeated total internal reflections and moves through the fiber.

### 🔹 Applications:
- High-speed internet and telecommunication
- Endoscopy in medical field
- Light transmission in instruments

## 11. Optical Instruments

### 🔸 Simple Microscope
- Used to magnify small objects.
- **Magnifying Power (M):**  
  `M = 1 + (D / f)`

  Where:  
  - `D` = least distance of distinct vision (usually 25 cm)  
  - `f` = focal length of the lens

---

### 🔸 Compound Microscope

- Uses two lenses: Objective and Eyepiece.
- **Magnifying Power (M):**  
  `M = (L / f₀) × (1 + D / fₑ)`

  Where:  
  - `L` = length of microscope tube  
  - `f₀` = focal length of objective  
  - `fₑ` = focal length of eyepiece

---

### 🔸 Astronomical Telescope

- Used to observe distant objects like stars and planets.
- Consists of objective lens and eyepiece.

### 🔹 In Normal Adjustment:
- Final image is formed at infinity for relaxed eye.

### 🔹 Magnifying Power (M):  
`M = f₀ / fₑ`

Where:  
- `f₀` = focal length of objective  
- `fₑ` = focal length of eyepiece

---

### 🔸 Resolving Power

- Ability of an optical instrument to distinguish between two closely spaced objects.

**For Telescope:**
`Resolving Power ∝ 1 / θ`

Where `θ` = angular separation of the objects.

---

### 🔸 Optical Projection Systems

Used in:
- Projectors
- Overhead transparency systems
- Cinema projection

Work on the principle of reflection and refraction using lenses and mirrors to produce magnified images on screens.

✅ **Conclusion:**
This unit focuses on the fundamental behavior of light, image formation using mirrors and lenses, important formulas, and working of optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes. It also explains the concept of total internal reflection and its application in modern technologies such as fiber optics.
