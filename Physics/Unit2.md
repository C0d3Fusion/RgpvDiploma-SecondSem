## UNIT - 2: Optics

Optics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior and properties of light, including its interactions with matter and the construction of instruments that use or detect light.

---

### Basic Optical Laws (मूल प्रकाशीय नियम)

Optics begins with a few fundamental rules that govern how light behaves when it interacts with surfaces or passes through different materials.

#### 1. Reflection (परावर्तन)

Reflection is the phenomenon where light rays, upon striking a surface, return to the same medium from which they originated. Think of light bouncing off a mirror.

* **Key Terms:**
    * **Incident Ray:** The light ray that falls on the surface.
    * **Reflected Ray:** The light ray that bounces back from the surface.
    * **Normal:** An imaginary line drawn perpendicular (90 degrees) to the surface at the point where the incident ray strikes.
    * **Angle of Incidence ($i$):** The angle between the incident ray and the normal.
    * **Angle of Reflection ($r$):** The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.

* **Laws of Reflection:**
    1.  The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
    2.  The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection ($i = r$).

* **Smart Trick:** When you look into a plane mirror, your image appears to be as far behind the mirror as you are in front of it, and it's upright. This is all due to reflection.

#### 2. Refraction (अपवर्तन)

Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium into another. This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media.

* **Key Terms:**
    * **Incident Ray:** The ray of light entering the first medium.
    * **Refracted Ray:** The ray of light that has bent and entered the second medium.
    * **Normal:** The line perpendicular to the interface between the two media at the point of incidence.
    * **Angle of Incidence ($i$):** The angle between the incident ray and the normal in the first medium.
    * **Angle of Refraction ($r$):** The angle between the refracted ray and the normal in the second medium.
    * **Rarer Medium:** A medium in which the speed of light is higher (e.g., air).
    * **Denser Medium:** A medium in which the speed of light is lower (e.g., water, glass).

* **Laws of Refraction:**
    1.  The incident ray, the refracted ray, and the normal to the interface at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.
    2.  **Snell's Law:** For any two given media and for a light of a given colour, the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant.

        * **Formula:**
            $$\frac{\sin i}{\sin r} = \text{constant} = n_{21}$$
            Here, $n_{21}$ is the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1.

* **Smart Trick:** When light goes from a rarer medium to a denser medium (e.g., air to water), it bends **towards** the normal. When it goes from a denser to a rarer medium (e.g., water to air), it bends **away** from the normal. This is why a pencil in a glass of water appears bent.

---

### Refractive Index (अपवर्तनांक)

The refractive index ($n$) is a dimensionless quantity that describes how fast light travels through a medium, or how much it bends light.

* **Definition:** The absolute refractive index of a medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium.

* **Formula:**
    $$n = \frac{c}{v}$$
    Where:
    * $c$ = Speed of light in vacuum ($\approx 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$)
    * $v$ = Speed of light in the medium

* **Relative Refractive Index:**
    When light travels from medium 1 to medium 2, the refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 ($n_{21}$) is given by:
    $$n_{21} = \frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{v_1}{v_2}$$
    Where:
    * $n_1$ = Refractive index of medium 1
    * $n_2$ = Refractive index of medium 2
    * $v_1$ = Speed of light in medium 1
    * $v_2$ = Speed of light in medium 2

* **Important Points:**
    * A medium with a higher refractive index is optically denser, and light travels slower in it.
    * The refractive index of air is approximately 1.

### Images and Image Formation by Mirrors (दर्पणों द्वारा प्रतिबिंब और प्रतिबिंब निर्माण)

An **image** is formed when light rays, after reflection from a mirror, actually meet or appear to meet at a point.

#### Types of Images:

1.  **Real Image:** Formed when light rays actually converge after reflection.
    * Can be obtained on a screen.
    * Always inverted (upside down) with respect to the object.
    * Example: Images projected in a cinema hall.

2.  **Virtual Image:** Formed when light rays appear to diverge from a point after reflection, but do not actually meet.
    * Cannot be obtained on a screen.
    * Always erect (upright) with respect to the object.
    * Example: Your reflection in a plane mirror.

#### Types of Mirrors:

1.  **Plane Mirror (समतल दर्पण):** A flat, highly polished reflecting surface.
    * **Image Properties:** Always forms a virtual, erect, and same-sized image as the object. The image is formed as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. It shows lateral inversion (left appears right, and vice versa).

2.  **Spherical Mirrors (गोलीय दर्पण):** These are parts of a hollow sphere whose one surface is polished. They are of two types:

    * **Concave Mirror (अवतल दर्पण):** Has its reflecting surface curved inwards (like the inner surface of a spoon).
        * It converges parallel rays of light to a single point (converging mirror).
        * Used in torches, searchlights, vehicle headlamps, dental mirrors, etc.
        * **Image Formation:** Can form both real and virtual images, depending on the object's position. Images can be smaller, larger, or the same size as the object.

    * **Convex Mirror (उत्तल दर्पण):** Has its reflecting surface curved outwards (like the outer surface of a spoon).
        * It diverges parallel rays of light (diverging mirror).
        * Commonly used as rear-view mirrors in vehicles because they always form an erect, virtual, and diminished (smaller) image, providing a wider field of view.
        * **Image Formation:** Always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image, regardless of the object's position.

#### Key Terms for Spherical Mirrors:

* **Pole (P):** The central point of the mirror's reflecting surface.
* **Centre of Curvature (C):** The centre of the hollow sphere of which the mirror is a part.
* **Radius of Curvature (R):** The distance between the pole and the centre of curvature.
* **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature.
* **Principal Focus (F):** The point on the principal axis where parallel rays of light converge (for concave mirrors) or appear to diverge from (for convex mirrors) after reflection.
* **Focal Length (f):** The distance between the pole and the principal focus.

* **Relationship between f and R:**
    $$f = \frac{R}{2}$$
    *The focal length is half of the radius of curvature.*

#### Mirror Formula (दर्पण सूत्र):

This formula relates the object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$) of a spherical mirror.

* **Formula:**
    $$\frac{1}{v} + \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$$
    Where:
    * $u$ = Object distance (distance from mirror to object)
    * $v$ = Image distance (distance from mirror to image)
    * $f$ = Focal length of the mirror

* **Sign Convention (Cartesian Sign Convention):**
    To consistently determine whether distances are positive or negative, we use the Cartesian sign convention:
    1.  All distances are measured from the pole (P) of the mirror.
    2.  Distances measured in the direction of the incident light are taken as positive (+).
    3.  Distances measured opposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (-).
    4.  Heights measured upwards from the principal axis are taken as positive (+).
    5.  Heights measured downwards from the principal axis are taken as negative (-).
    * For concave mirrors, focal length ($f$) is negative.
    * For convex mirrors, focal length ($f$) is positive.

#### Magnification ($m$) (आवर्धन):

Magnification describes how much larger or smaller the image is compared to the object.

* **Formula:**
    $$m = \frac{\text{Height of Image}}{\text{Height of Object}} = \frac{h'}{h}$$
    Also,
    $$m = -\frac{v}{u}$$
    Where:
    * $h'$ = Height of the image
    * $h$ = Height of the object

* **Important Points about Magnification:**
    * If $m$ is positive, the image is erect and virtual.
    * If $m$ is negative, the image is inverted and real.
    * If $|m| > 1$, the image is magnified (larger than the object).
    * If $|m| < 1$, the image is diminished (smaller than the object).
    * If $|m| = 1$, the image is the same size as the object.

### Lenses and Thin Lenses (लेंस और पतले लेंस)

A **lens** is a transparent optical device with at least one curved surface that refracts light to form an image.

#### Types of Lenses:

1.  **Convex Lens (उत्तल लेंस):** These lenses are thicker in the middle and thinner at the edges.
    * They converge parallel rays of light to a single point (converging lens).
    * Also known as **converging lenses**.
    * Used in magnifying glasses, eyeglasses (for hypermetropia), cameras, microscopes, telescopes, etc.
    * **Image Formation:** Can form both real and virtual images, depending on the object's position. Images can be smaller, larger, or the same size as the object.

2.  **Concave Lens (अवतल लेंस):** These lenses are thinner in the middle and thicker at the edges.
    * They diverge parallel rays of light (diverging lens).
    * Also known as **diverging lenses**.
    * Used in eyeglasses (for myopia), peepholes in doors, etc.
    * **Image Formation:** Always forms a virtual, erect, and diminished image, regardless of the object's position.

#### Key Terms for Lenses:

* **Optical Centre (O):** The central point of the lens, through which light rays pass without any deviation.
* **Principal Axis:** The straight line passing through the optical centre and perpendicular to the surfaces of the lens.
* **Principal Focus (F1, F2):** Lenses have two principal foci, one on each side. Parallel rays of light, after refraction through the lens, either converge to a point (convex lens) or appear to diverge from a point (concave lens) on the principal axis.
* **Focal Length (f):** The distance between the optical centre and the principal focus.

#### Lens Formula (लेंस सूत्र):

This formula relates the object distance ($u$), image distance ($v$), and focal length ($f$) of a thin lens.

* **Formula:**
    $$\frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u} = \frac{1}{f}$$
    Where:
    * $u$ = Object distance (distance from lens to object)
    * $v$ = Image distance (distance from lens to image)
    * $f$ = Focal length of the lens

* **Sign Convention:**
    Similar to mirrors, all distances are measured from the optical centre.
    * For convex lenses, focal length ($f$) is positive (+).
    * For concave lenses, focal length ($f$) is negative (-).

#### Magnification ($m$) (आवर्धन):

For lenses, magnification is calculated as:

* **Formula:**
    $$m = \frac{\text{Height of Image}}{\text{Height of Object}} = \frac{h'}{h}$$
    Also,
    $$m = \frac{v}{u}$$

* **Important Points about Magnification:**
    * If $m$ is positive, the image is erect and virtual.
    * If $m$ is negative, the image is inverted and real.
    * If $|m| > 1$, the image is magnified.
    * If $|m| < 1$, the image is diminished.
    * If $|m| = 1$, the image is the same size as the object.

### Power of Lens (लेंस की शक्ति)

The **power of a lens** is a measure of its ability to converge or diverge light rays.

* **Definition:** The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length in meters.

* **Formula:**
    $$P = \frac{1}{f \text{ (in meters)}}$$

* **Unit:** The unit of power of a lens is **Dioptre (D)**. If the focal length is 1 meter, the power is 1 Dioptre.

* **Important Points:**
    * A convex lens has a positive focal length, so its power is **positive (+D)**.
    * A concave lens has a negative focal length, so its power is **negative (-D)**.
    * A shorter focal length means greater lens power (the lens bends light more strongly).

* **Combination of Thin Lenses in Contact:**
    If two or more thin lenses are placed in contact, their total (equivalent) power is the sum of the individual powers of the lenses.
    $$P_{\text{total}} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \ldots$$
    And the total focal length ($F_{\text{total}}$) is:
    $$\frac{1}{F_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} + \frac{1}{f_3} + \ldots$$
    This principle is crucial in making eyeglasses with specific required powers.

### Defects of Vision (दृष्टि दोष)

These are conditions where the human eye fails to function properly, leading to blurred or unclear vision. These defects can often be corrected using corrective lenses (eyeglasses).

1.  **Myopia (Nearsightedness / निकट दृष्टि दोष):**
    * **Problem:** A person can see nearby objects clearly but distant objects appear blurry.
    * **Reason:** Either the eyeball is too long, or the focal length of the eye lens is too short. Light from distant objects focuses in front of the retina.
    * **Correction:** Corrected using a **concave lens** (diverging lens), which spreads out the light rays before they enter the eye, allowing them to focus correctly on the retina.

2.  **Hypermetropia (Farsightedness / दूर दृष्टि दोष):**
    * **Problem:** A person can see distant objects clearly but nearby objects appear blurry.
    * **Reason:** Either the eyeball is too short, or the focal length of the eye lens is too long. Light from nearby objects focuses behind the retina.
    * **Correction:** Corrected using a **convex lens** (converging lens), which converges the light rays before they enter the eye, allowing them to focus correctly on the retina.

3.  **Presbyopia (जरादूरदर्शिता):**
    * **Problem:** With increasing age, the flexibility of the eye lens decreases, and the ciliary muscles weaken, reducing the eye's power of accommodation. This makes it difficult to see both near and distant objects clearly.
    * **Correction:** Often corrected using **bifocal lenses**, which have a concave upper portion for distant vision and a convex lower portion for near vision.

4.  **Astigmatism (दृष्टिवैषम्य):**
    * **Problem:** A person cannot see horizontal and vertical lines equally clearly at the same time.
    * **Reason:** Irregular curvature of the cornea (the front transparent part of the eye) or the lens.
    * **Correction:** Corrected using **cylindrical lenses**.

### Total Internal Reflection (पूर्ण आंतरिक परावर्तन)

This is a remarkable optical phenomenon that occurs when light attempts to travel from a denser medium to a rarer medium.

#### Conditions for Total Internal Reflection (TIR):

1.  **Light must travel from a denser medium to a rarer medium.** (e.g., from water to air, or glass to air).
2.  **The angle of incidence ($i$) in the denser medium must be greater than the critical angle ($C$) for the pair of media.**

#### Critical Angle ($C$):

The critical angle is a specific angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the rarer medium is 90 degrees. This means the refracted ray travels along the interface between the two media.

* **Formula for Critical Angle:**
    Using Snell's Law, if $n_1$ is the refractive index of the denser medium and $n_2$ is the refractive index of the rarer medium (where $n_1 > n_2$):
    $$n_1 \sin C = n_2 \sin 90^\circ$$
    Since $\sin 90^\circ = 1$:
    $$n_1 \sin C = n_2$$   $$\sin C = \frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
    If the rarer medium is air ($n_2 \approx 1$), then:
    $$\sin C = \frac{1}{n_1}$$

* **What happens during TIR:** When the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, instead of being refracted into the rarer medium, the light is entirely reflected back into the denser medium. This is total internal reflection.

#### Applications of Total Internal Reflection:

1.  **Optical Fiber (ऑप्टिकल फाइबर):**
    * These are thin strands of glass or plastic designed to transmit light over long distances.
    * **Structure:** An optical fiber consists of a central core (higher refractive index) surrounded by a cladding (lower refractive index).
    * When light enters the core at a specific angle, it repeatedly undergoes total internal reflection at the core-cladding interface, propagating through the fiber without significant loss.
    * **Uses:**
        * **High-speed internet:** For data transmission.
        * **Telecommunications:** For phone calls and TV signals.
        * **Medical Endoscopy:** To view internal organs of the body.
        * **Decorative lamps:** Fiber optic lamps.

2.  **Mirage (मृगतृष्णा):** The illusion of water on a hot road or in a desert is due to TIR.

3.  **Brilliance of Diamond (हीरे की चमक):** Diamonds sparkle brilliantly because of their very high refractive index, which results in a very small critical angle. The way they are cut ensures that most light entering the diamond undergoes multiple total internal reflections, making it glitter.

4.  **Prisms:** Some prisms use TIR to deviate light by 90 or 180 degrees, as seen in periscopes or binoculars.

### Optical Instruments (प्रकाशिक उपकरण)

These are devices that use the principles of light to make distant objects appear closer or small objects appear larger.

#### 1. Simple Microscope (सरल सूक्ष्मदर्शी / Magnifying Glass)

A simple microscope is essentially a single convex lens of short focal length.

* **Working Principle:** When a small object is placed within the focal length of a convex lens, the lens forms a virtual, erect, and magnified image.

* **Magnifying Power (MP or M):**
    Magnifying power is the ratio of the angle subtended by the image at the eye to the angle subtended by the object at the eye when viewed directly at the least distance of distinct vision.

    * **When image is formed at D (near point / least distance of distinct vision, D = 25 cm):**
        $$M = 1 + \frac{D}{f}$$
    * **When image is formed at infinity (Normal Adjustment):**
        $$M = \frac{D}{f}$$
        Where:
        * $D$ = Least distance of distinct vision (approx. 25 cm)
        * $f$ = Focal length of the lens

* **Uses:**
    * To view small objects magnified (e.g., by watchmakers or jewelers).
    * As a reading glass.

#### 2. Compound Microscope (संयुक्त सूक्ष्मदर्शी)

A compound microscope uses two convex lenses to achieve much higher magnification for observing very small objects.

* **Construction:**
    It mainly consists of two convex lenses:
    1.  **Objective Lens:** Placed near the object, it has a short focal length and small aperture.
    2.  **Eyepiece Lens:** Placed near the eye, it has a comparatively larger focal length and aperture.

* **Working Principle:**
    * The objective lens forms a real, inverted, and magnified image of the object.
    * This image then acts as a virtual object for the eyepiece lens.
    * The eyepiece lens then forms a final, highly magnified, virtual, and inverted image (inverted with respect to the original object).

* **Magnifying Power (MP or M):**
    The total magnifying power of a compound microscope is the product of the magnifications of the objective and eyepiece lenses.
    $$M = M_o \times M_e$$
    Where:
    * $M_o$ = Magnification due to objective lens
    * $M_e$ = Magnification due to eyepiece lens

    * **For final image at D (least distance of distinct vision):**
        $$M = \frac{L}{f_o} \left(1 + \frac{D}{f_e}\right)$$
    * **For final image at infinity (Normal Adjustment):**
        $$M = \frac{L}{f_o} \frac{D}{f_e}$$
        Where:
        * $L$ = Length of the microscope tube (distance between objective and eyepiece)
        * $f_o$ = Focal length of the objective lens
        * $f_e$ = Focal length of the eyepiece lens
        * $D$ = Least distance of distinct vision (25 cm)

* **Uses:**
    * To observe microscopic organisms, cells, and tissues in biology and medicine.
    * For studying microstructures in materials science and forensics.

#### 3. Astronomical Telescope in Normal Adjustment (खगोलीय दूरबीन सामान्य समायोजन में)

An **astronomical telescope** is used to view very distant celestial objects (like stars, planets, galaxies). Normal adjustment refers to the condition where the final image is formed at infinity, allowing the eye to be relaxed.

* **Construction:**
    It also consists of two convex lenses, but unlike the compound microscope:
    1.  **Objective Lens:** Large aperture and long focal length (to gather more light from distant objects).
    2.  **Eyepiece Lens:** Small aperture and short focal length.

* **Working Principle (Normal Adjustment):**
    * Parallel rays from a distant object (at infinity) pass through the objective lens and form a real, inverted image at its focal point ($F_o$).
    * This image is formed exactly at the focal point of the eyepiece lens ($F_e$), meaning $F_o$ and $F_e$ coincide.
    * Since the image from the objective is at the eyepiece's focal point, the eyepiece forms a final, highly magnified, virtual, and inverted image at infinity relative to the original object.

* **Magnifying Power (MP or M):**
    **For Astronomical Telescope in Normal Adjustment:**
    $$M = -\frac{f_o}{f_e}$$
    Where:
    * $f_o$ = Focal length of the objective lens
    * $f_e$ = Focal length of the eyepiece lens
    * The negative sign indicates that the final image is inverted with respect to the object.

* **Length of Telescope (L):**
    In normal adjustment, the length of the telescope is the sum of the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece.
    $$L = f_o + f_e$$

* **Uses:**
    * For observing celestial bodies (stars, planets, moon, etc.).
    * For viewing distant objects on Earth (though terrestrial telescopes are often preferred as they provide an erect image).

### Resolving Power (विभेदन क्षमता)

**Resolving power** is the ability of an optical instrument to distinguish between two closely spaced objects as separate entities. A higher resolving power means the instrument can show finer details and separate objects that are very close together.

* **For Microscope:**
    The resolving power of a microscope depends on the numerical aperture of the objective lens and the wavelength of light used.
    $$\text{Resolving Power} = \frac{2 n \sin\theta}{\lambda}$$
    Where:
    * $n \sin\theta$ is the numerical aperture.
    * $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light.
    * To increase resolving power, one can use light of a shorter wavelength (e.g., blue light or UV light) and lenses with a higher numerical aperture.

* **For Telescope:**
    The resolving power of a telescope depends on the diameter (aperture) of its objective lens and the wavelength of light.
    $$\text{Resolving Power} \propto \frac{D}{\lambda}$$
    Where:
    * $D$ = Diameter of the objective lens
    * $\lambda$ = Wavelength of light
    * To increase resolving power, a larger objective lens diameter and shorter wavelength light are beneficial.

* **Smart Trick:** A microscope with higher resolving power can distinguish between smaller, closely packed details. A telescope with higher resolving power can separate two very close distant objects (like two stars that appear as one to the naked eye).

### Optical Projection Systems (प्रकाशिक प्रक्षेपण प्रणाली)

Optical projection systems are devices that project an enlarged image of a small object onto a large screen. Projectors are a common example.

* **Working Principle:**
    Typically, it involves a powerful light source, a condenser lens (to focus light onto the object), a slide or film containing the small image, and a projection lens.
    * Light from the source passes through the condenser lens, illuminating the small image on the slide.
    * The light from the illuminated image then passes through the projection lens.
    * The projection lens forms a real, magnified, and inverted image of the slide onto a distant screen. (This is why slides or films are often placed upside down in the projector to appear upright on the screen).

* **Main Components:**
    1.  **Light Source:** A powerful bulb (e.g., halogen lamp).
    2.  **Condenser Lens:** Gathers light from the source and directs it uniformly onto the transparency/slide.
    3.  **Transparency/Slide:** Contains the small image to be projected.
    4.  **Projection Lens:** A converging lens (convex lens) that forms the enlarged image on the screen.

* **Uses:**
    * **Cinema Projectors:** To display movies on large screens.
    * **Overhead Projectors (OHP):** Used in meetings and classrooms to project notes and diagrams (less common now, largely replaced by digital projectors).
    * **Digital Projectors:** To display images and videos from computers, laptops, or other digital sources onto large screens.
    * **Photography Enlargers:** To create larger photographic prints from negatives.
