# UNIT 4: Current Electricity

Current electricity deals with the flow of electric charges (mainly electrons) in a conductor. It includes concepts like electric current, resistance, Ohm’s law, power, energy, and basic laws of circuits.

## 1. Electric Current

**Electric Current (I)** is the rate of flow of electric charge.

**Formula:**

    I = Q / t

Where:  
- `I` = Current (Ampere, A)  
- `Q` = Charge (Coulombs)  
- `t` = Time (seconds)

**Unit**: Ampere (A)  
1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb / 1 second

---

## 2. Types of Current

- **Direct Current (DC)**: Flows in one direction (e.g., battery).
- **Alternating Current (AC)**: Changes direction periodically (e.g., household electricity).

---

## 3. Resistance (R)

Resistance is the opposition offered by a material to the flow of electric current.

**Formula:**

    R = V / I

Where:  
- `R` = Resistance (Ohm, Ω)  
- `V` = Voltage (Volt)  
- `I` = Current (Ampere)

---

## 4. Specific Resistance or Resistivity (ρ)

Resistivity is the resistance of a wire of unit length and unit cross-sectional area.

**Formula:**

    R = ρ × (L / A)

Where:  
- `ρ` = Resistivity (Ohm·m)  
- `L` = Length of wire (m)  
- `A` = Cross-sectional area (m²)

---

## 5. Conductance (G)

Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance.

**Formula:**

    G = 1 / R  
Unit: Siemens (S)

---

## 6. Specific Conductance (σ)

Specific conductance is the reciprocal of resistivity.

**Formula:**

    σ = 1 / ρ

---

## 7. Combination of Resistors

### a. Series Combination:

- Total Resistance:  
  **R_total = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ...**

- Current remains same in all resistors.

### b. Parallel Combination:

- Total Resistance:  
  **1 / R_total = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ...**

- Voltage remains same across all resistors.

---

## 8. Factors Affecting Resistance of a Wire

- **Length (L)** → More length = more resistance  
- **Area (A)** → More area = less resistance  
- **Material** → Different materials have different resistivity  
- **Temperature** → Resistance increases with temperature in metals

## 9. Carbon Resistors and Colour Coding

Carbon resistors have color bands indicating resistance value.

**Color Code Table:**

| Color | Digit | Multiplier (×Ω) |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| Black | 0     | 1               |
| Brown | 1     | 10              |
| Red   | 2     | 100             |
| Orange| 3     | 1,000           |
| Yellow| 4     | 10,000          |
| Green | 5     | 100,000         |
| Blue  | 6     | 1,000,000       |
| Violet| 7     | 10⁷             |
| Grey  | 8     | 10⁸             |
| White | 9     | 10⁹             |

## 10. Ohm’s Law

Ohm’s Law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided temperature remains constant.

**Formula:**

    V = I × R

Verification: Using a circuit with a variable resistor, ammeter, and voltmeter.

---

## 11. Kirchhoff’s Laws

### a. Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL):

The total current entering a junction = total current leaving it.

### b. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL):

Sum of voltage drops in a closed loop = total EMF in the loop.

---

## 12. Wheatstone Bridge

Used to measure unknown resistance using a balanced bridge.

**Condition for balance:**

    (R₁ / R₂) = (R₃ / R₄)

**Slide Wire Bridge** is a practical form of Wheatstone Bridge.

---

## 13. Terminal Potential Difference and EMF

- **EMF (Electromotive Force)**: Maximum voltage provided by a cell when no current flows.  
- **Terminal Potential Difference**: Voltage across terminals when current flows (less than EMF due to internal resistance).

**Formula:**

    V = E - Ir

Where:  
- `V` = Terminal voltage  
- `E` = EMF of cell  
- `I` = Current  
- `r` = Internal resistance

---

## 14. Heating Effect of Current

When current flows through a resistor, heat is produced.

**Formula:**

    H = I² × R × t

Where:  
- `H` = Heat energy (Joule)  
- `I` = Current (Ampere)  
- `R` = Resistance (Ohm)  
- `t` = Time (second)

---

## 15. Electric Power

Power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed or produced.

**Formula:**

    P = V × I  
Also,  
    P = I² × R or P = V² / R

**Unit:** Watt (W)

---

## 16. Electric Energy

Total energy consumed in time:

**Formula:**

    E = P × t

Units:
- Joule (J)
- Kilowatt-hour (kWh) → 1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J

## 17. Advantages of Electric Energy

- Easy to transport through wires
- Clean and pollution-free
- High efficiency and control
- Can be converted into other forms easily (heat, light, motion)

- Use Kirchhoff’s laws to solve circuit loops.
- Find heat energy produced in resistors.
- Determine energy consumed in units for household devices.
