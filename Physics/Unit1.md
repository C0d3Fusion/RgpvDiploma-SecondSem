# UNIT 1: Wave Motion and Its Applications

---

## 1. Wave Motion

**Definition:**  
Wave motion is a type of disturbance that travels through a medium by the vibration of its particles. It transfers energy from one point to another without the actual transfer of matter.

There are two main types of waves:

---

### 🔹 Transverse Waves

- The particles of the medium vibrate **perpendicular** (at 90°) to the direction of wave movement.
- **Examples:**
  - Light waves
  - Water waves
  - Waves on a stretched string

---

### 🔹 Longitudinal Waves

- The particles of the medium vibrate **parallel** to the direction of wave movement.
- **Examples:**
  - Sound waves
  - Compression waves in a spring

---

## 2. Basic Terms of Waves

### 🔸 Wave Velocity (v)
- It is the speed at which the wave moves through the medium.
- **Formula:**  
  `Wave Velocity (v) = Frequency (f) × Wavelength (λ)`

### 🔸 Frequency (f)
- Number of wave cycles passing a point per second.
- Unit: Hertz (Hz)

### 🔸 Wavelength (λ)
- The distance between two consecutive crests or compressions.
- Unit: meters (m)

### 🔸 Relationship:
- `v = f × λ`

---

## 3. Sound and Light Waves

### 🔹 Sound Waves
- Longitudinal in nature
- Require a medium to travel (like air)
- Travel slower than light

### 🔹 Light Waves
- Transverse in nature
- Can travel through vacuum
- Much faster than sound (speed of light ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s)

---

## 4. Wave Equation

A general equation of a wave is:

`y = r × sin(ωt + φ)`

Where:
- `y` = displacement at time `t`
- `r` = amplitude (maximum displacement)
- `ω` = angular frequency = 2πf
- `t` = time
- `φ` = phase constant

---

## 5. Amplitude, Phase, and Phase Difference

- **Amplitude (r):** Maximum displacement from the mean position.
- **Phase:** Describes the position of the particle at a given time.
- **Phase Difference:** Difference in phase between two points in a wave.

---

## 6. Superposition of Waves

When two or more waves pass through the same point, their displacements add up.

### Equation:
`Resultant Displacement (y) = y₁ + y₂`

### Types of Interference:
- **Constructive Interference:** When waves are in phase, amplitudes add up.
- **Destructive Interference:** When waves are out of phase, amplitudes cancel out.

---

## 7. Beats

**Definition:**  
When two waves of nearly equal frequencies interfere, they produce periodic variations in amplitude. This phenomenon is called **beats**.

**Beat Frequency:**
`f_beat = |f₁ - f₂|`

Where:
- `f₁` and `f₂` are the frequencies of the two waves.

---

## 8. Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM)

### 🔹 Definition:
SHM is the motion in which the restoring force is directly proportional to displacement and acts in the opposite direction.

### 🔹 Equations:

- **Displacement:**  
  `y = A × sin(ωt + φ)`

- **Velocity:**  
  `v = Aω × cos(ωt + φ)`

- **Acceleration:**  
  `a = -Aω² × sin(ωt + φ)`

- **Time Period (T):**  
  `T = 1 / f`

- **Frequency (f):**  
  `f = 1 / T`

Where:
- `A` = amplitude
- `ω` = angular frequency = 2πf

---

## 9. Simple Harmonic Progressive Wave

A progressive wave transfers energy from one point to another through SHM.

---

## 10. Vibration of Cantilever

### 🔹 Cantilever:
A beam fixed at one end and free at the other.

When a cantilever is disturbed, it vibrates in SHM.

**Time Period (T) of Cantilever:**

`T = 2π × √(l³ / (3gk))`

Where:
- `l` = length of cantilever
- `g` = acceleration due to gravity
- `k` = constant depending on the material and shape

---

## 11. Free, Forced, and Resonant Vibrations

### 🔹 Free Vibrations:
- Occur without any external force after initial disturbance.
- Example: Tuning fork after hitting.

### 🔹 Forced Vibrations:
- Occur under the influence of an external periodic force.
- Example: Guitar string vibrating when touched.

### 🔹 Resonant Vibrations:
- When the frequency of the external force matches the natural frequency of the object, leading to maximum amplitude.
- Example: Breaking of a glass due to high-pitched sound.

## 12. Acoustics of Buildings

### 🔸 Reverberation:
- Repeated reflection of sound in a hall.
- Makes sound last longer.

### 🔸 Reverberation Time:
- Time taken for sound to decay to one-millionth of its original intensity after the source stops.

### 🔸 Echo:
- Reflection of sound heard after 0.1 seconds.

### 🔸 Noise:
- Unwanted and unpleasant sound.

### 🔸 Coefficient of Absorption:
- It is the ratio of sound energy absorbed to the sound energy incident on a surface.

---

## 13. Methods to Control Reverberation

- Use of absorbing materials like carpets, curtains, acoustic panels
- Use of false ceilings
- Proper ventilation and furniture

---

## 14. Ultrasonic Waves

### 🔸 Introduction:
- Sound waves having frequency more than 20,000 Hz (above human hearing range)

### 🔸 Properties:
- High frequency
- Travel in straight lines
- Can be reflected and focused

### 🔸 Applications:

**Engineering:**
- Ultrasonic cleaning
- Welding
- Flaw detection in metal parts

**Medical:**
- Ultrasound scanning
- Kidney stone treatment
- Dental cleaning
