## ðŸ”¹ 1. Transformers: Construction and Principle

### ðŸ”¸ General Construction:
- **Core:** Laminated iron core to reduce eddy current losses.
- **Primary Winding:** Connected to AC supply.
- **Secondary Winding:** Provides the transformed voltage.
- **Insulation:** Between core and windings for safety.

### ðŸ”¸ Working Principle:
- Based on **mutual induction**.
- AC in primary winding produces alternating magnetic flux in the core.
- This induces emf in the secondary winding according to Faradayâ€™s law.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. EMF Equation of Transformer

The induced emf in primary or secondary winding is given by:

```
E = 4.44 Ã— f Ã— N Ã— Î¦_max
```

Where,  
- E = RMS voltage induced (Volts)  
- f = frequency (Hz)  
- N = number of turns in the winding  
- Î¦_max = maximum flux in the core (Webers)

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Transformation Ratio

- Ratio of primary to secondary voltage:

```
k = V_primary / V_secondary = N_primary / N_secondary
```

- **Step-up Transformer:** Secondary voltage > Primary voltage  
- **Step-down Transformer:** Secondary voltage < Primary voltage

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Autotransformer

- Has a **single winding** acting as both primary and secondary.
- Part of winding is common to both sides.
- Provides variable voltage output.
- More efficient and smaller in size compared to two-winding transformers for same power rating.
- **Voltage transformation ratio** same as two-winding transformer.

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Electric Motors: Construction and Working Principle

### ðŸ”¸ Construction:
- **Stator:** Stationary part, provides magnetic field.
- **Rotor:** Rotating part, carries armature winding.
- **Commutator (in DC motor):** Maintains direction of current in the armature.
- **Brushes:** Provide electrical contact to rotating part.

### ðŸ”¸ Working Principle:
- Based on **Lorentz force**: A current carrying conductor in magnetic field experiences force.
- This force produces torque causing rotor to rotate.
- Direction of force given by **Fleming's Left-Hand Rule**.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Basic Equations of Motors

### ðŸ”¸ Torque (T):
```
T = F Ã— r = B Ã— I Ã— L Ã— r Ã— sinÎ¸
```
Where,  
- B = magnetic flux density  
- I = current in conductor  
- L = length of conductor in magnetic field  
- r = radius of rotor

### ðŸ”¸ Power Input (P_in):
```
P_in = V Ã— I
```

### ðŸ”¸ Mechanical Power Output (P_out):
```
P_out = T Ã— Ï‰
```
Where, Ï‰ = angular velocity (rad/s)
