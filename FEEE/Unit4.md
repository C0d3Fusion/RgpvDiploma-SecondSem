## UNIT IV: Electric and Magnetic Circuits

This unit establishes the foundational principles of electricity and magnetism, including their interconnectedness through electromagnetic induction. It also draws analogies between electric and magnetic circuits to aid understanding.

### I. Electric Circuit Fundamentals

An electric circuit is a closed path through which electric current can flow.

#### A. EMF (Electromotive Force)

* **Definition:** EMF is the energy per unit electric charge that is imparted by an energy source, such as a battery or generator. It's the "push" or "force" that drives current in a circuit. It is not actually a force, but a potential difference.
* **Unit:** Volt (V).
* **Source:** Batteries, generators, solar cells.
* **Concept:** It represents the work done by the source in moving a unit charge from one point to another.

#### B. Current (I)

* **Definition:** The rate of flow of electric charge. It is the movement of electrons (or positive charge carriers in conventional current) through a conductor.
* **Unit:** Ampere (A).
* **Formula:** $I = \frac{dQ}{dt}$
    * Where:
        * $I$ = Current (Amperes)
        * $Q$ = Charge (Coulombs)
        * $t$ = Time (seconds)
* **Types:**
    * **Direct Current (DC):** Flow in one direction (e.g., from a battery).
    * **Alternating Current (AC):** Flow periodically reverses direction (e.g., household mains).

#### C. Potential Difference (Voltage, V)

* **Definition:** The difference in electric potential between two points in an electric circuit. It represents the work required to move a unit positive charge from one point to another.
* **Unit:** Volt (V).
* **Relation to EMF:** EMF is the potential difference produced by a source when no current is flowing (open-circuit voltage). Potential difference across a component is the voltage drop across it when current flows.
* **Ohm's Law:** For a resistor, $V = I \times R$, where $R$ is resistance in Ohms ($\Omega$).

#### D. Power (P)

* **Definition:** The rate at which electrical energy is converted from one form to another (e.g., electrical to heat, light, or mechanical energy).
* **Unit:** Watt (W).
* **Formula:**
    * $P = V \times I$
    * Substituting $V = IR$: $P = I^2 \times R$
    * Substituting $I = V/R$: $P = V^2 / R$
    * Where:
        * $P$ = Power (Watts)
        * $V$ = Voltage (Volts)
        * $I$ = Current (Amperes)
        * $R$ = Resistance (Ohms)

#### E. Energy (E or W)

* **Definition:** The capacity to do work. In electrical terms, it's the total amount of work done or dissipated by electrical components over a period of time.
* **Unit:** Joule (J) or Watt-hour (Wh) or Kilowatt-hour (kWh).
* **Formula:**
    * $E = P \times t$
    * Substituting $P = VI$: $E = V \times I \times t$
    * Substituting $P = I^2R$: $E = I^2 R t$
    * Substituting $P = V^2/R$: $E = \frac{V^2}{R} t$
    * Where:
        * $E$ = Energy (Joules)
        * $P$ = Power (Watts)
        * $t$ = Time (seconds)

### II. Magnetic Circuit Fundamentals

A magnetic circuit is a closed path for magnetic flux, similar to an electric circuit for electric current.

#### A. M.M.F (Magnetomotive Force)

* **Definition:** The "force" that produces magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit, analogous to EMF in an electric circuit. It is proportional to the number of turns in a coil and the current flowing through it.
* **Unit:** Ampere-turns (AT).
* **Formula:** $F = N \times I$
    * Where:
        * $F$ = MMF (Ampere-turns)
        * $N$ = Number of turns in the coil
        * $I$ = Current flowing through the coil (Amperes)

#### B. Magnetic Force

* **Definition:** The force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field, or the force between magnetic poles.
* **Unit:** Newton (N).
* **Formula (Force on a current-carrying conductor in a uniform magnetic field):**
    * $F = B I L \sin(\theta)$
        * Where:
            * $F$ = Magnetic force (Newtons)
            * $B$ = Magnetic field strength (Tesla, T)
            * $I$ = Current (Amperes)
            * $L$ = Length of the conductor in the field (meters)
            * $\theta$ = Angle between the direction of current and the magnetic field.
    * **Lorentz Force (Force on a moving charge):** $F = q (v \times B)$ or $F = qvB\sin(\theta)$

#### C. Permeability ($\mu$)

* **Definition:** A measure of a material's ability to support the formation of a magnetic field within itself. It indicates how easily magnetic flux lines can pass through a material.
* **Unit:** Henry per meter (H/m).
* **Formula:** $\mu = \mu_r \mu_0$
    * Where:
        * $\mu$ = Absolute permeability of the material
        * $\mu_r$ = Relative permeability of the material (dimensionless, $\mu_r \ge 1$)
        * $\mu_0$ = Permeability of free space (vacuum) = $4\pi \times 10^{-7}$ H/m.
* **Types of Materials:**
    * **Paramagnetic:** $\mu_r > 1$ (slightly attracted to magnetic fields, e.g., aluminum, platinum).
    * **Diamagnetic:** $\mu_r < 1$ (slightly repelled, e.g., copper, water).
    * **Ferromagnetic:** $\mu_r \gg 1$ (strongly attracted, e.g., iron, nickel, cobalt). These are used in core materials for electromagnets, transformers, etc.

#### D. Hysteresis Loop

* **Definition:** A graph that shows the relationship between the magnetic flux density (B) and the magnetic field strength (H) in a ferromagnetic material as the magnetizing force is cycled (increased and decreased).
* **Description:**
    * When a magnetizing force (H) is applied to an unmagnetized ferromagnetic material, B increases.
    * As H increases further, B reaches saturation.
    * When H is reduced to zero, B does not return to zero. The material retains some magnetization, called **Retentivity ($B_r$)**.
    * To reduce B to zero, a reverse magnetizing force, called **Coercivity ($H_c$)**, must be applied.
    * As H is varied further, the B-H curve forms a closed loop, the **hysteresis loop**.
* **Significance:**
    * **Energy Loss:** The area of the hysteresis loop represents the energy lost as heat (hysteresis loss) during each cycle of magnetization. This loss is undesirable in AC applications like transformers.
    * **Material Properties:**
        * **Hard Magnetic Materials:** Large loop area, high retentivity and coercivity (good for permanent magnets).
        * **Soft Magnetic Materials:** Small loop area, low retentivity and coercivity (good for transformer cores, electromagnets).

#### E. Reluctance ($\mathcal{R}$)

* **Definition:** The opposition that a magnetic circuit offers to the establishment of magnetic flux, analogous to resistance in an electric circuit.
* **Unit:** Ampere-turns per Weber (AT/Wb) or inverse Henry ($H^{-1}$).
* **Formula:** $\mathcal{R} = \frac{l}{\mu A}$
    * Where:
        * $\mathcal{R}$ = Reluctance
        * $l$ = Length of the magnetic path (meters)
        * $\mu$ = Permeability of the material (H/m)
        * $A$ = Cross-sectional area of the magnetic path ($m^2$)
* **Hopkinson's Law (Magnetic Ohm's Law):** $\Phi = \frac{F}{\mathcal{R}}$
    * Where:
        * $\Phi$ = Magnetic flux (Webers, Wb)
        * $F$ = MMF (Ampere-turns)
        * $\mathcal{R}$ = Reluctance

#### F. Leakage Factor

* **Definition:** In practical magnetic circuits (like transformers or motors), not all the magnetic flux produced by the MMF passes through the intended magnetic path. Some flux "leaks" into the surrounding air or other non-magnetic paths. This wasted flux is called **leakage flux**.
* **Formula:** Leakage Factor ($\lambda$) = $\frac{\text{Total Flux Produced}}{\text{Useful Flux}}$
* **Significance:** Leakage flux reduces the efficiency of magnetic devices. Designers try to minimize it by optimizing core shapes and winding arrangements.

#### G. BH Curve (Magnetization Curve)

* **Definition:** A plot of magnetic flux density (B) versus magnetic field strength (H) for a specific magnetic material. It is also known as the magnetization curve.
* **Description:**
    * Initially, B increases linearly with H in the unsaturated region.
    * As H increases further, the material starts to saturate, and B increases non-linearly and then flattens out, indicating that most of the magnetic domains are aligned.
    * The BH curve for a virgin (unmagnetized) material is the central path of a hysteresis loop starting from the origin.
* **Significance:**
    * It provides crucial information about a material's magnetic properties.
    * Used in the design of electromagnets, transformers, and other magnetic devices to select appropriate core materials.

### III. Electromagnetic Induction

The phenomenon where an EMF is induced in a conductor when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field. This is the basis of operation for generators, transformers, and many other electrical machines.

#### A. Faraday's Laws of Electromagnetic Induction

1.  **First Law:** Whenever a conductor is placed in a varying magnetic field, an electromotive force (EMF) is induced. If the conductor circuit is closed, a current is induced.
    * **Interpretation:** Magnetic flux linkage through the circuit must change for an EMF to be induced. This change can be due to:
        * A changing magnetic field through a stationary coil.
        * A coil moving through a static magnetic field.
        * A coil changing its orientation in a magnetic field.
2.  **Second Law:** The magnitude of the induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage with the circuit.
    * **Formula:** $E = -N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$
        * Where:
            * $E$ = Induced EMF (Volts)
            * $N$ = Number of turns in the coil
            * $\Phi$ = Magnetic flux (Webers)
            * $\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$ = Rate of change of magnetic flux
    * The negative sign is due to Lenz's Law.

#### B. Lenz's Law

* **Definition:** States that the direction of the induced current (and thus the induced EMF) is always such as to oppose the change in magnetic flux that caused it.
* **Principle of Conservation of Energy:** Lenz's Law is a manifestation of the conservation of energy. If the induced current aided the change in flux, it would lead to a perpetual motion machine, which is impossible.
* **Example:** If you move a magnet's North pole towards a coil, the induced current in the coil will flow in a direction that creates a North pole at the end of the coil facing the magnet, thus repelling the incoming magnet.

#### C. Dynamically Induced EMF

* **Definition:** EMF induced in a conductor when the conductor moves in a stationary magnetic field (or the magnetic field moves and the conductor is stationary, as long as there's relative motion).
* **Mechanism:** As the conductor cuts magnetic flux lines, charge carriers within the conductor experience a magnetic force (Lorentz force) that pushes them to one end, creating a potential difference.
* **Formula (for a straight conductor moving perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field):**
    * $E = B l v \sin(\theta)$
        * Where:
            * $E$ = Induced EMF (Volts)
            * $B$ = Magnetic field strength (Tesla)
            * $l$ = Length of the conductor (meters)
            * $v$ = Velocity of the conductor (m/s)
            * $\theta$ = Angle between the velocity vector and the magnetic field vector. (For maximum EMF, $\theta = 90^\circ$, so $E = Blv$).
* **Applications:** Generators (DC and AC), motors (as back EMF).

#### D. Statically Induced EMF

* **Definition:** EMF induced in a conductor (coil) when the magnetic flux linking it changes due to a changing current in the same coil or in an adjacent coil, while the coil itself is stationary.
* **Mechanism:** No physical motion is involved. The change in flux is purely due to time-varying currents.
* **Types:**
    * **Self-Induced EMF:** Induced in a coil due to the change of current in the same coil.
    * **Mutually Induced EMF:** Induced in a coil due to the change of current in a *neighboring* coil.
* **Applications:** Transformers, inductors.

#### E. Equations of Self and Mutual Inductance

* **Self-Inductance (L):**
    * **Definition:** The property of a coil to induce an EMF in itself due to a change in the current flowing through it. It's a measure of how much magnetic flux is generated per unit current.
    * **Unit:** Henry (H).
    * **Formula (Induced EMF):**
        * $E_L = -L \frac{dI}{dt}$
            * Where:
                * $E_L$ = Self-induced EMF (Volts)
                * $L$ = Self-inductance (Henries)
                * $\frac{dI}{dt}$ = Rate of change of current (A/s)
    * **Formula (in terms of flux linkage):**
        * $L = \frac{N\Phi}{I}$
            * Where $N\Phi$ is the total flux linkage.
    * **Formula (for a solenoid):**
        * $L = \frac{\mu N^2 A}{l}$
            * Where $\mu$ is permeability, $N$ is turns, $A$ is cross-sectional area, $l$ is length.

* **Mutual Inductance (M):**
    * **Definition:** The property by which a change in current in one coil induces an EMF in a nearby, magnetically coupled coil.
    * **Unit:** Henry (H).
    * **Formula (Induced EMF in Coil 2 due to Coil 1):**
        * $E_2 = -M \frac{dI_1}{dt}$
            * Where:
                * $E_2$ = EMF induced in coil 2 (Volts)
                * $M$ = Mutual inductance (Henries)
                * $\frac{dI_1}{dt}$ = Rate of change of current in coil 1 (A/s)
    * **Formula (Induced EMF in Coil 1 due to Coil 2):**
        * $E_1 = -M \frac{dI_2}{dt}$
    * **Relationship with Self-Inductance and Coupling Coefficient:**
        * $M = k \sqrt{L_1 L_2}$
            * Where $k$ is the **coupling coefficient** ($0 \le k \le 1$). $k=1$ for perfect coupling (e.g., ideal transformer), $k=0$ for no coupling.
* **Applications:** Transformers, induction motors, wireless power transfer.

**Important Note on Analogy:** While the analogy is useful, it's not perfect.
* In an electric circuit, energy is dissipated as heat in resistors. In a magnetic circuit, energy is *stored* in the magnetic field, and only dissipated as heat if the material exhibits hysteresis or eddy currents (which are themselves induced currents).
* Electric current flows through a path; magnetic flux does not "flow" in the same sense but rather permeates a region.
