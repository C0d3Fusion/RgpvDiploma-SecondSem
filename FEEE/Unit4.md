# 📘 UNIT IV: Electric and Magnetic Circuits

---

## 🔹 1. Basic Electrical Terms

### 🔸 EMF (Electromotive Force)
- It is the **energy supplied** by a source per unit charge.
- **Unit:** Volt (V)
- Denoted by **E**
```
E = W / Q
Where,
W = Work done (in joules), Q = Charge (in coulombs)
```

### 🔸 Current (I)
- Flow of electric charge per second.
- **Unit:** Ampere (A)
```
I = Q / t
```

### 🔸 Potential Difference (V)
- Difference in electric potential between two points.
- **Unit:** Volt (V)

### 🔸 Power (P)
- Rate at which work is done or energy is consumed.
```
P = V × I
```

### 🔸 Energy (W)
- Total work done by the source.
```
W = V × I × t
```

## 🔹 2. Magnetic Circuit Concepts

### 🔸 M.M.F (Magneto Motive Force)
- Magnetic equivalent of EMF.
```
MMF = N × I
Where, N = Number of turns, I = Current (A)
```

### 🔸 Magnetic Field Strength (H)
```
H = MMF / l
Where, l = length of magnetic path
```

### 🔸 Magnetic Flux (ϕ)
- Number of magnetic lines of force.
```
ϕ = B × A
Where, B = Magnetic flux density (Wb/m²), A = Area
```

### 🔸 Permeability (μ)
- Ability of material to support magnetic field.
```
B = μ × H
```
- μ = μ₀ × μr  
  μ₀ = 4π × 10⁻⁷ H/m (vacuum), μr = relative permeability

---

## 🔹 3. Hysteresis Loop

- Shows the **relation between magnetic flux density (B)** and **magnetic field strength (H)**.
- Important characteristics:
  - **Retentivity**: Ability to retain magnetic property.
  - **Coercivity**: Reverse field needed to demagnetize.
  - **Hysteresis Loss**: Energy lost per cycle.
  
🌀 *Area under the loop = Hysteresis loss*

---

## 🔹 4. Reluctance (S)

- Magnetic equivalent of resistance.
```
S = l / (μ × A)
```
- l = length, μ = permeability, A = area

---

## 🔹 5. Leakage Factor

- Ratio of **total flux** to **useful flux**.
```
Leakage factor = Total flux / Useful flux
```
- Always >1 due to unwanted stray flux.

---

## 🔹 6. B-H Curve

- Graph between **magnetic field strength (H)** and **magnetic flux density (B)**.
- Used to understand **magnetization** of a material.

---

## 🔹 7. Electromagnetic Induction

### 🔸 Faraday's Laws:
1. **First Law:** A changing magnetic field produces an emf.
2. **Second Law:** Induced emf is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.
```
E = -N × (dϕ/dt)
```

### 🔸 Lenz’s Law:
- Direction of induced emf **opposes the change** in magnetic flux.
- Explains the negative sign in Faraday's formula.

---

## 🔹 8. Types of Induced EMF

### 🔸 Dynamically Induced EMF
- Coil moves through a magnetic field.
```
E = B × l × v × sin(θ)
```

### 🔸 Statically Induced EMF
- Flux changes, but coil is stationary.

---

## 🔹 9. Self and Mutual Inductance

### 🔸 Self Inductance (L)
- When a changing current in a coil induces emf in the **same coil**.
```
E = -L × (dI/dt)
```

### 🔸 Mutual Inductance (M)
- When a changing current in one coil induces emf in **another coil**.
```
E = -M × (dI₂/dt)
```

## 🔹 10. Analogy: Electric vs Magnetic Circuit

| Electric Circuit         | Magnetic Circuit             |
|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| EMF (V)                  | MMF (NI)                     |
| Current (I)              | Flux (ϕ)                     |
| Resistance (R)           | Reluctance (S)               |
| Ohm’s Law: V = I × R     | Magnetic Law: NI = ϕ × S     |

## ✅ Summary Points for Exam:
- Memorize all basic formulas: EMF, Current, Power, MMF, Flux, etc.
- Understand magnetic concepts like **hysteresis, B-H curve, and reluctance**.
- Practice **Faraday’s and Lenz’s laws** with direction.
- Revise differences between **dynamically vs statically induced EMF**.
- Remember the **analogy table** (common in theory questions).

📚 *This unit is theory-heavy, so focus on diagrams, formulas, and definitions.*
