## UNIT II: Overview of Analog Circuits

This unit primarily focuses on one of the most versatile and fundamental active analog circuit building blocks: the Operational Amplifier (Op-Amp).

### Operational Amplifiers (Op-Amps)

An operational amplifier (Op-Amp) is a high-gain, differential input, single-ended output voltage amplifier. It's an active component that plays a crucial role in a vast array of analog circuits, from simple amplifiers to complex filters and signal conditioning systems. Its name comes from its original use in analog computers to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, integration, and differentiation.

#### A. Ideal Op-Amp

An "ideal" op-amp is a theoretical model that simplifies the analysis of op-amp circuits by assuming perfect characteristics. While no real op-amp is ideal, this model provides excellent approximations for many practical applications due to the high performance of modern op-amps.

**Key Characteristics of an Ideal Op-Amp:**

1.  **Infinite Open-Loop Gain ($A_{OL} = \infty$):** This means even a minuscule difference in voltage between the input terminals will produce an infinitely large output voltage. In practice, this implies that any output voltage within the supply rails requires the input differential voltage to be virtually zero.
2.  **Infinite Input Impedance ($R_{in} = \infty$):** No current flows into either of the input terminals (inverting or non-inverting). This is a crucial property for voltage sensing without loading the source.
    * **Implication:** $I_{in-} = 0$ and $I_{in+} = 0$.
3.  **Zero Output Impedance ($R_{out} = 0$):** The output voltage remains constant regardless of the current drawn by the load. This means the op-amp can deliver any current required by the load without its output voltage dropping.
    * **Implication:** It behaves as a perfect voltage source at its output.
4.  **Infinite Bandwidth ($BW = \infty$):** The gain remains constant from DC up to infinite frequency. In reality, op-amps have limited bandwidth.
5.  **Zero Input Offset Voltage:** If both input terminals are at the same voltage (e.g., grounded), the output voltage is exactly zero.
6.  **Infinite Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR):** The op-amp amplifies only the difference between the two input signals and completely rejects any common signal present at both inputs.
7.  **Zero Slew Rate:** The output voltage can change instantaneously, which means it can respond to any input signal change without delay. In reality, there's a limit to how fast the output can change.

**The "Golden Rules" of Ideal Op-Amp Analysis (when negative feedback is applied):**

These rules are direct consequences of the ideal op-amp characteristics and are invaluable for quick circuit analysis:

1.  **No current flows into the input terminals:** $I_{in-} = I_{in+} = 0$ (due to infinite input impedance).
2.  **The voltage difference between the input terminals is zero:** $V_{in-} = V_{in+}$ (due to infinite open-loop gain and negative feedback). This is often called the "virtual short" or "virtual ground" concept.

#### B. Practical Op-Amp

Practical op-amps deviate from the ideal model in several ways, but their characteristics are often good enough to approximate the ideal behavior in many applications. Understanding these non-ideal characteristics is important for designing high-precision or high-frequency circuits.

**Key Characteristics of a Practical Op-Amp (Non-ideal):**

1.  **Finite Open-Loop Gain ($A_{OL}$):** While very high (e.g., $10^5$ to $10^6$ V/V or 100-120 dB), it's not infinite. This limits the precision of gain calculations and can lead to errors.
2.  **Finite Input Impedance ($R_{in}$):** Very high (e.g., $10^6$ to $10^{12} \Omega$), but not infinite. A tiny input bias current (picoamperes to nanoamperes) does flow into the input terminals.
    * **Input Bias Current ($I_B$):** The average current flowing into the two input terminals.
    * **Input Offset Current ($I_{OS}$):** The difference between the two input bias currents.
3.  **Non-Zero Output Impedance ($R_{out}$):** Small (e.g., 50-200 $\Omega$), but not zero. This means the output voltage will drop slightly when a load current is drawn.
4.  **Finite Bandwidth ($BW$):** The open-loop gain decreases with increasing frequency. This is often characterized by the **Gain-Bandwidth Product (GBW or GBWP)**, which is constant for a given op-amp. $GBW = |A_{OL}| \times BW$.
5.  **Input Offset Voltage ($V_{OS}$):** A small DC voltage (e.g., a few millivolts) that must be applied between the input terminals to make the output voltage zero. This causes a DC error at the output.
6.  **Finite Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR):** A measure of how well the op-amp rejects common-mode signals. A high CMRR (e.g., 80-120 dB) is desirable.
7.  **Finite Slew Rate (SR):** The maximum rate at which the output voltage can change (e.g., V/$\mu$s). If the input signal changes too rapidly, the output will "slew" and distort the signal.
8.  **Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR):** Measures how well the op-amp rejects variations in its power supply voltage.
9.  **Noise:** Op-amps generate their own internal noise, which can limit the minimum detectable signal.

#### C. Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Configurations

The way an op-amp is connected determines its behavior.

##### 1. Open-Loop Configuration

* **Description:** No feedback path from the output to the input terminals. The op-amp operates at its maximum open-loop gain.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Extremely high gain ($A_{OL}$).
    * Output voltage will quickly saturate (go to +Vcc or -Vcc) even for tiny input differential voltages, because the gain is so high.
    * Highly sensitive to noise and temperature variations.
    * Not suitable for linear amplification due to its tendency to saturate.
* **Applications:** Primarily used as a comparator (e.g., comparing two voltages and outputting a high or low state).

##### 2. Closed-Loop Configuration

* **Description:** A portion of the output signal is fed back to one of the input terminals. This feedback is almost always **negative feedback**, where a portion of the output is fed back to the inverting input.
* **Characteristics:**
    * **Reduced Gain:** The overall circuit gain (closed-loop gain) is significantly reduced compared to the open-loop gain, but it becomes predictable and stable.
    * **Increased Bandwidth:** The bandwidth of the circuit is increased.
    * **Reduced Sensitivity:** Less sensitive to variations in op-amp parameters, temperature, and power supply.
    * **Reduced Distortion:** Improves linearity.
    * **Reduced Output Impedance & Increased Input Impedance:** Makes the circuit more robust.
* **Benefits of Negative Feedback:** It is the cornerstone of linear op-amp circuit design, making the circuit characteristics dependent primarily on the external passive components rather than the op-amp's inherent (and varying) characteristics.

#### D. Applications of Op-Amp

Op-amps are incredibly versatile and can be configured to perform a wide range of analog signal processing tasks. Here are some fundamental applications:

##### 1. Amplifier (Non-Inverting and Inverting)

###### a. Inverting Amplifier

* **Configuration:** The input signal is applied to the inverting input terminal through a resistor ($R_{in}$), and the non-inverting input is grounded. A feedback resistor ($R_f$) connects the output to the inverting input.
* **Circuit Diagram:**
    ```
          Rin       Rf
        ----[ ]----[ ]----
       |            |     |
       |            |     | Vout
     Vin --(-)------|-----O
              |     |
              |     |
             (+)----|
              |     |
             GND   GND
    ```
* **Operation (Ideal Op-Amp Analysis):**
    * By "virtual short" rule: $V_{in-} = V_{in+} = 0$ (since non-inverting input is grounded).
    * By "no input current" rule: $I_{in-} = 0$.
    * Current through $R_{in}$: $I_{Rin} = \frac{V_{in} - V_{in-}}{R_{in}} = \frac{V_{in} - 0}{R_{in}} = \frac{V_{in}}{R_{in}}$
    * Since $I_{in-} = 0$, the current $I_{Rin}$ must flow through $R_f$.
    * Current through $R_f$: $I_{Rf} = \frac{V_{in-} - V_{out}}{R_f} = \frac{0 - V_{out}}{R_f} = -\frac{V_{out}}{R_f}$
    * Equating currents ($I_{Rin} = I_{Rf}$):
        $\frac{V_{in}}{R_{in}} = -\frac{V_{out}}{R_f}$
* **Voltage Gain ($A_v$):**
    * $A_v = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}$
* **Characteristics:**
    * The output voltage is an amplified and **inverted** version of the input signal.
    * Input impedance is approximately $R_{in}$.
    * Widely used due to its simplicity and stability.

###### b. Non-Inverting Amplifier

* **Configuration:** The input signal is applied directly to the non-inverting input terminal. A feedback network (voltage divider with $R_1$ and $R_2$) connects the output to the inverting input, and $R_1$ is connected to ground.
* **Circuit Diagram:**
    ```
                Rf
          ----[ ]----
         |          |
         |          |
      Vin --(+)------|----- Vout
                |   |
                |   |
               (-)---|---[ R1 ]--- GND
                      |
                     GND
    ```
    (Note: Some diagrams label the feedback resistors as $R_f$ and $R_g$ or $R_2$ and $R_1$. Let's use $R_f$ and $R_1$ where $R_1$ goes to ground.)
* **Operation (Ideal Op-Amp Analysis):**
    * By "virtual short" rule: $V_{in-} = V_{in+} = V_{in}$
    * The voltage at $V_{in-}$ is determined by the voltage divider formed by $R_f$ and $R_1$ from $V_{out}$.
    * $V_{in-} = V_{out} \times \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_f}$
    * Since $V_{in-} = V_{in}$:
        $V_{in} = V_{out} \times \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_f}$
* **Voltage Gain ($A_v$):**
    * $A_v = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_1}$
* **Characteristics:**
    * The output voltage is an amplified and **non-inverted** version of the input signal.
    * Extremely high input impedance (ideally infinite), making it ideal for buffering or impedance matching.
    * The gain is always $\ge 1$.

##### 2. Adder (Summing Amplifier)

* **Configuration:** A variation of the inverting amplifier where multiple input signals are applied to the inverting input through separate input resistors.
* **Circuit Diagram:**
    ```
            R1         Rf
        V1 --[ ]----[ ]----
            |        |     |
            |        |     | Vout
        V2 --[ ]----|-----O
            |        |
            |        |
        V3 --[ ]----(-)----
                     |
                    (+)---- GND
                     |
                    GND
    ```
* **Operation (Ideal Op-Amp Analysis):**
    * By "virtual short" rule: $V_{in-} = V_{in+} = 0$ (virtual ground at inverting input).
    * By "no input current" rule: $I_{in-} = 0$.
    * Sum of currents at the inverting node: $\frac{V_1 - 0}{R_1} + \frac{V_2 - 0}{R_2} + \frac{V_3 - 0}{R_3} + \frac{0 - V_{out}}{R_f} = 0$
* **Output Voltage:**
    * $\frac{V_1}{R_1} + \frac{V_2}{R_2} + \frac{V_3}{R_3} = \frac{V_{out}}{R_f}$
    * $V_{out} = -R_f \left( \frac{V_1}{R_1} + \frac{V_2}{R_2} + \frac{V_3}{R_3} \right)$
* **Special Case (If $R_1 = R_2 = R_3 = R_{in}$):**
    * $V_{out} = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}} (V_1 + V_2 + V_3)$
    * If $R_f = R_{in}$, then $V_{out} = -(V_1 + V_2 + V_3)$.
* **Characteristics:**
    * Adds multiple input voltages and provides an inverted sum (or weighted sum).
    * Versatile for mixing audio signals, performing digital-to-analog conversion (DAC).

##### 3. Differentiator

* **Configuration:** A capacitor ($C_{in}$) is placed at the input to the inverting terminal, and a resistor ($R_f$) is used in the feedback path. The non-inverting input is grounded.
* **Circuit Diagram:**
    ```
             Cin         Rf
         --||--[ ]----[ ]----
        |            |     |
        |            |     | Vout
      Vin --(-)------|-----O
               |     |
               |     |
              (+)----|
               |     |
              GND   GND
    ```
* **Operation (Ideal Op-Amp Analysis):**
    * By "virtual short" rule: $V_{in-} = V_{in+} = 0$ (virtual ground).
    * By "no input current" rule: $I_{in-} = 0$.
    * Current through capacitor: $I_{Cin} = C_{in} \frac{d(V_{in} - V_{in-})}{dt} = C_{in} \frac{d(V_{in} - 0)}{dt} = C_{in} \frac{dV_{in}}{dt}$
    * Current through feedback resistor: $I_{Rf} = \frac{V_{in-} - V_{out}}{R_f} = \frac{0 - V_{out}}{R_f} = -\frac{V_{out}}{R_f}$
    * Equating currents ($I_{Cin} = I_{Rf}$):
        $C_{in} \frac{dV_{in}}{dt} = -\frac{V_{out}}{R_f}$
* **Output Voltage:**
    * $V_{out} = -R_f C_{in} \frac{dV_{in}}{dt}$
* **Characteristics:**
    * The output voltage is proportional to the **rate of change** (derivative) of the input voltage, and it's inverted.
    * **Problem:** Ideal differentiators are prone to noise amplification at high frequencies (because differentiation amplifies high-frequency components). This often requires adding a small resistor in series with $C_{in}$ to limit high-frequency gain.
* **Applications:** Edge detection (in image processing), rate-of-change measurement, creating pulse waveforms from square waves.

##### 4. Integrator

* **Configuration:** A resistor ($R_{in}$) is placed at the input to the inverting terminal, and a capacitor ($C_f$) is used in the feedback path. The non-inverting input is grounded.
* **Circuit Diagram:**
    ```

        ----[ ]----||----
       |           |     |

     Vin --(-)-----|-----O
             |     |
             |     |
            (+)----|
             |     |
            GND   GND
    ```
* **Operation (Ideal Op-Amp Analysis):**
    * By "virtual short" rule: $V_{in-} = V_{in+} = 0$ (virtual ground).
    * By "no input current" rule: $I_{in-} = 0$.
    * Current through input resistor: $I_{Rin} = \frac{V_{in} - V_{in-}}{R_{in}} = \frac{V_{in} - 0}{R_{in}} = \frac{V_{in}}{R_{in}}$
    * Current through feedback capacitor: $I_{Cf} = C_f \frac{d(V_{in-} - V_{out})}{dt} = C_f \frac{d(0 - V_{out})}{dt} = -C_f \frac{dV_{out}}{dt}$
    * Equating currents ($I_{Rin} = I_{Cf}$):
        $\frac{V_{in}}{R_{in}} = -C_f \frac{dV_{out}}{dt}$
    * Rearranging to solve for $dV_{out}/dt$:
        $\frac{dV_{out}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{R_{in}C_f} V_{in}$
    * Integrating both sides with respect to time:
        $V_{out}(t) = -\frac{1}{R_{in}C_f} \int V_{in}(t) dt + V_{initial}$
        (where $V_{initial}$ is the initial voltage across the capacitor, often assumed to be 0 if the capacitor is initially uncharged).
* **Output Voltage:**
    * $V_{out}(t) = -\frac{1}{R_{in}C_f} \int_{0}^{t} V_{in}(\tau) d\tau$ (assuming $V_{out}(0) = 0$)
* **Characteristics:**
    * The output voltage is proportional to the **integral** of the input voltage, and it's inverted.
    * **Problem:** Ideal integrators accumulate DC offset and noise over time, causing the output to "drift" or saturate. A large resistor is often placed in parallel with $C_f$ to provide a DC path for the feedback and limit the DC gain.
* **Applications:** Waveform shaping (e.g., converting a square wave into a triangular wave), analog-to-digital conversion (ramp generation), active filters, signal averaging.
