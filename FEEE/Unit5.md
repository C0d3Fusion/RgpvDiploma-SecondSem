## ðŸ”¹ 2. Impedance (Z), Phase Angle (Ï•), and Power Factor (pf)

- **Impedance (Z):** Total opposition to AC, combining resistance and reactance.
```
Z = âˆš(RÂ² + (X_L - X_C)Â²)
```
Where,
- R = resistance,
- X_L = inductive reactance = Ï‰L,
- X_C = capacitive reactance = 1 / (Ï‰C).

- **Phase Angle (Ï•):**
```
tan Ï• = (X_L - X_C) / R
```
- Ï• indicates phase difference between voltage and current.

- **Power Factor (pf):**
```
pf = cos Ï• = P / (Vrms Ã— Irms)
```
- Power factor shows how effectively the current is converted into useful work.

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Mathematical and Phasor Representation of Alternating emf and Current

- Instantaneous voltage:
```
v = Vm Ã— sin(Ï‰t)
```
- Instantaneous current:
```
i = Im Ã— sin(Ï‰t Â± Ï•)
```
- **Phasors** are rotating vectors representing sinusoidal quantities.

| Connection | Voltage Relation                   | Current Relation                  |
|------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Star (Y)   | Phase Voltage (Vph) = Line Voltage (VL) / âˆš3 | Line Current (IL) = Phase Current (Iph) |

## ðŸ”¹ 7. Power in AC Circuits and Power Triangle

- **Real Power (P):**  
Power actually consumed  
```
P = Vrms Ã— Irms Ã— cos Ï•
```

- **Reactive Power (Q):**  
Power stored and returned  
```
Q = Vrms Ã— Irms Ã— sin Ï•
```

- **Apparent Power (S):**  
Product of Vrms and Irms  
```
S = Vrms Ã— Irms
```

### Power Triangle:

```
