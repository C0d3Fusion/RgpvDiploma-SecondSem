### ðŸ”¸ (b) Signal Values

#### ðŸ”¹ Average Value (V_avg)
- Mean value over one cycle (mainly for rectified signals)

#### ðŸ”¹ RMS Value (V_rms)
- Equivalent DC value that produces same power
  ```
  V_rms = V_peak / âˆš2  (for sine wave)
  ```

#### ðŸ”¹ Peak Value (V_peak)
- Maximum value of the signal waveform

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Sources

### ðŸ”¸ (a) Ideal Sources
- Provide constant voltage or current regardless of load.
- **Ideal voltage source:** Zero internal resistance
- **Ideal current source:** Infinite internal resistance

### ðŸ”¸ (b) Non-Ideal Sources
- Real sources have internal resistance, so output varies with load.

### ðŸ”¸ (c) Independent Sources
- Provide voltage or current without depending on other circuit variables.

### ðŸ”¸ (d) Dependent (Controlled) Sources
- Output depends on some voltage or current in the circuit.
- Types:
  - Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source (VCVS)
  - Voltage-Controlled Current Source (VCCS)
  - Current-Controlled Voltage Source (CCVS)
  - Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS)
