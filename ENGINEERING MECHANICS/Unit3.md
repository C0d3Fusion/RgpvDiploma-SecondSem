# ðŸ“˜ UNIT III: Friction â€” Important Formulas Explained Simply

---

### 1. Coefficient of Friction (Î¼)

- **Meaning:** It shows how strong the friction is between two surfaces.  
- Formula:

> **Coefficient of friction (Î¼) = (Maximum friction force) Ã· (Normal force)**

Mathematically,

```
Î¼ = Limiting friction force / Normal reaction force
```

---

### 2. Relation between Coefficient of Friction and Angle of Friction (Ï†)

- The angle of friction Ï† is the angle between the normal force and the resultant force of normal and friction forces.  
- Simple formula:

```
Î¼ = tan(Ï†)
```

*So, if you know the angle Ï†, just take its tangent to find Î¼.*

### 3. On a Level Surface (Horizontal Surface):

- When a force \(P\) is applied horizontally, friction opposes it.

- Condition for equilibrium (body doesnâ€™t move):

```
Applied force (P) â‰¤ Maximum friction force (F_limiting)
```

And,

```
F_limiting = Î¼ Ã— Normal force (N)
```

Here, the normal force \(N\) is usually equal to the weight \(W\) if the surface is horizontal.

---

### 4. On an Inclined Plane:

- The weight \(W\) can be split into two parts:  
   - Parallel to the slope (pulling the body down):

```
W_parallel = W Ã— sin(Î¸)
```

   - Perpendicular to the slope (supporting force):

```
N = W Ã— cos(Î¸)
```

- Friction force opposes sliding down the slope:

```
F_friction = Î¼ Ã— N = Î¼ Ã— W Ã— cos(Î¸)
```

- Condition for equilibrium (body at rest):

```
Applied force (P) + Friction force (F_friction) â‰¥ Weight component pulling down (W_parallel)
```
