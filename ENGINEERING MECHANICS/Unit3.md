# ðŸ“˜ UNIT III: Friction

---

## 1. Introduction to Friction

- **Friction:** The resistive force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces in contact.
- **Relevance in Engineering:**  
  - Essential for walking, driving, gripping, braking, etc.  
  - Causes wear and energy loss but also provides necessary traction.

## 2. Types of Friction

| Type                | Description                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Static Friction**   | Friction when there is no relative motion (body at rest). |
| **Kinetic (Dynamic) Friction** | Friction when surfaces slide relative to each other. |
| **Rolling Friction**  | Resistance when a body rolls over a surface. |

---

## 3. Laws of Friction

1. **Frictional force is proportional to the normal reaction:**  
   \[
   F \propto N
   \]

2. **Frictional force is independent of the area of contact.**

3. **Frictional force is almost independent of relative speed between surfaces (for low speeds).**

---

## 4. Limiting Friction and Limiting Equilibrium

- **Limiting Friction:** Maximum frictional force that can be developed between two surfaces before motion begins.
- When friction reaches this maximum value, the body is on the verge of motion and said to be in **limiting equilibrium**.

---

## 5. Coefficient of Friction (Î¼)

- Defined as the ratio of limiting friction to the normal reaction.  
- Formula:

\[
\mu = \frac{F_{\text{limiting}}}{N}
\]

Where:  
- \(F_{\text{limiting}}\) = limiting friction force  
- \(N\) = normal reaction force

---

## 6. Angle of Friction (Ï†)

- The angle made by the resultant of the normal reaction and limiting friction with the normal reaction.  
- It represents the maximum angle at which a body can be inclined before it starts slipping.

---

## 7. Angle of Repose (Î¸)

- The angle of inclination of an inclined plane with the horizontal at which a body placed on it just begins to slide down due to gravity.  
- It equals the angle of friction for a given pair of surfaces.

---

## 8. Relation Between Coefficient of Friction and Angle of Friction

\[
\mu = \tan \phi
\]

Where:  
- \(\mu\) = coefficient of friction  
- \(\phi\) = angle of friction

---

## 9. Equilibrium of Bodies on Level Surface

- When a force \(P\) acts parallel to the surface and a friction force \(F\) acts to oppose motion.

**Condition of equilibrium:**

\[
P \leq F_{\text{limiting}} = \mu N
\]

Where \(N\) is the normal reaction, usually equal to the weight \(W\) for a horizontal surface.

---

## 10. Equilibrium of Bodies on Inclined Plane

- Weight \(W\) acts vertically downward, and normal reaction \(N\) acts perpendicular to plane.

---

### Case 1: Body subjected to force parallel to plane

- Components of weight along the plane:

\[
W_{\parallel} = W \sin \theta
\]

- Normal reaction:

\[
N = W \cos \theta
\]

- Frictional force:

\[
F = \mu N = \mu W \cos \theta
\]

**Condition for equilibrium (no sliding):**

\[
P + F \geq W_{\parallel}
\]

---

### Case 2: Body subjected to force parallel and inclined to the plane

- Resolve forces carefully along and perpendicular to the plane to check equilibrium conditions.  
- Friction acts opposite to the tendency of motion.

---

## âœ… Exam Tips:

- Remember definitions of limiting friction, angle of friction, and angle of repose.  
- Use \(\mu = \tan \phi\) for easy conversion.  
- Practice free body diagrams on inclined planes with friction.  
- Solve equilibrium equations carefully considering direction of friction.  
- Be clear on difference between static and kinetic friction.
