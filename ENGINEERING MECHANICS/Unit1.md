## Unit – I: Basics of Mechanics and Force System

This unit introduces the fundamental concepts of engineering mechanics, focusing on the study of forces and their effects on bodies at rest or in motion.

### I. Significance and Relevance of Mechanics

* **Mechanics:** The branch of physics concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment. It is the foundation for analyzing and designing virtually all structures and mechanical systems.
* **Applied Mechanics:** This discipline applies the principles of mechanics to solve engineering problems. It forms the backbone of various engineering fields, including civil, mechanical, aeronautical, and materials engineering.
* **Statics:**
    * **Definition:** The branch of mechanics that deals with bodies at rest or moving at a constant velocity (i.e., in equilibrium).
    * **Relevance:** Crucial for designing stable structures (bridges, buildings), ensuring that components do not move or deform excessively under load. It focuses on conditions of equilibrium where the net force and net moment on a body are zero.
* **Dynamics:**
    * **Definition:** The branch of mechanics that deals with bodies in motion where forces cause acceleration. It is further divided into Kinematics and Kinetics.
        * **Kinematics:** Describes the motion of bodies (displacement, velocity, acceleration) without considering the forces causing the motion.
        * **Kinetics:** Relates the forces on bodies to the resulting motion (i.e., considering mass and acceleration).
    * **Relevance:** Essential for designing moving parts (machinery, vehicles, robots), analyzing vibrations, and predicting trajectories.

### II. Basic Concepts in Mechanics

* **Space:** The geometric region occupied by bodies. It is a three-dimensional region in which the positions and orientations of objects are defined by coordinates.
* **Time:** The measure of the succession of events. It is a fundamental quantity and plays a crucial role in dynamics, where it is used to define velocity and acceleration.
* **Mass:** A measure of the inertia of a body, which is its resistance to a change in velocity. It is also a measure of the quantity of matter in a body. Unlike weight, mass is independent of gravity.
* **Particle:** An idealized body that has mass but negligible dimensions. It is used when the size and shape of a body are irrelevant to the analysis of its motion or equilibrium. This simplification allows treating all forces as acting at a single point.
* **Flexible Body:** A body that undergoes significant deformation when subjected to forces. Its shape changes, and internal stresses and strains are important considerations. Examples include ropes, cables, and rubber bands.
* **Rigid Body:** An idealized body whose deformation under the action of forces is negligible or can be ignored. The distance between any two points within a rigid body remains constant, regardless of the applied forces. This simplification greatly simplifies analysis in statics and dynamics, as only the overall motion of the body needs to be considered, not its internal deformations.

### III. Scalar and Vector Quantity

* **Scalar Quantity:**
    * **Definition:** A physical quantity that is completely described by its magnitude (a numerical value and a unit) only. It does not have a direction.
    * **Examples:** Mass (kg), time (s), temperature ($^\circ$C), volume ($m^3$), speed (m/s), energy (J), distance (m).
* **Vector Quantity:**
    * **Definition:** A physical quantity that requires both magnitude and direction for its complete description.
    * **Examples:** Force (N), velocity (m/s), acceleration (m/$s^2$), displacement (m), momentum (kg.m/s), moment (N.m).
    * **Representation:** Vectors are typically represented graphically by an arrow where the length of the arrow represents the magnitude, and the arrowhead indicates the direction. Mathematically, they are denoted by bold letters (e.g., **F**) or with an arrow above (e.g., $\vec{F}$).

### IV. Units of Measurement (SI Units)

The International System of Units (SI) is the universally accepted system of measurement in science and engineering.

* **Fundamental (Base) Units:** Seven independent base units from which all other units are derived.
    * **Length:** meter (m)
    * **Mass:** kilogram (kg)
    * **Time:** second (s)
    * Electric Current: ampere (A)
    * Thermodynamic Temperature: kelvin (K)
    * Amount of Substance: mole (mol)
    * Luminous Intensity: candela (cd)
* **Derived Units:** Units formed by combining fundamental units through multiplication or division.
    * **Force:** Newton (N) = kg·m/s$^2$
    * **Energy/Work:** Joule (J) = N·m = kg·m$^2$/s$^2$
    * **Power:** Watt (W) = J/s = kg·m$^2$/s$^3$
    * **Pressure:** Pascal (Pa) = N/$m^2$
    * **Frequency:** Hertz (Hz) = 1/s

### V. Force

#### A. Unit of Force

* **Newton (N):** In SI units, the unit of force is the Newton. One Newton is defined as the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram by one meter per second squared.
    * $1 \text{ N} = 1 \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m/s}^2$

#### B. Representation of Force

* **As a Vector:** As discussed, force is a vector quantity. It is represented by an arrow whose length is proportional to its magnitude and whose direction indicates the direction of the force. The point of application can also be shown.
* **By Bow's Notation:** A method used in graphical force analysis (e.g., in truss analysis) where forces acting on a structure are named by the letters placed on either side of the force in the space diagram. For example, a force between spaces A and B would be referred to as force AB. This makes it easy to identify forces in a force polygon.

#### C. Characteristics and Effects of a Force

* **Characteristics (Elements of a Force):** To completely define a force, four characteristics must be specified:
    1.  **Magnitude:** How strong the force is (e.g., 100 N).
    2.  **Direction:** The line of action of the force (e.g., horizontal, vertical, at an angle).
    3.  **Sense (or Point of Application):** Whether it pushes or pulls along its line of action, or the specific point on the body where it acts.
    4.  **Point of Application:** The specific point on the body where the force is applied.
* **Effects of a Force:** When a force acts on a body, it can cause:
    * **External Effects:**
        * Change in the state of motion (acceleration).
        * Deformation of the body.
        * Tendency to rotate the body (moment/torque).
    * **Internal Effects:**
        * Internal stresses and strains within the body.

#### D. Principle of Transmissibility of Force

* **Statement:** The external effect of a force on a rigid body remains unchanged if the force is moved along its line of action to another point on the body.
* **Explanation:** This principle applies only to the *external* effects (net force, net moment, and overall motion/equilibrium) on a rigid body. It does *not* imply that the internal effects (stress and strain) will be the same. For internal effects, the actual point of application matters.
* **Significance:** Simplifies force analysis by allowing us to slide forces along their lines of action for convenience in calculations (e.g., finding moments).

#### E. Force System and its Classification

A force system is a collection of forces acting on a body. They are classified based on the relative arrangement of their lines of action.

1.  **Coplanar Force System:** All forces lie in the same plane.
    * **Coplanar Concurrent:** Lines of action of all forces meet at a single point in the plane. (e.g., forces acting on a hook).
    * **Coplanar Parallel:** Lines of action of all forces are parallel to each other in the plane. (e.g., uniformly distributed load on a beam, or forces on a simply supported beam).
    * **Coplanar Non-Concurrent, Non-Parallel (General Coplanar):** Lines of action of forces lie in the same plane but do not meet at a single point and are not parallel. (e.g., forces on a ladder leaning against a wall).

2.  **Non-Coplanar Force System:** Forces do not all lie in the same plane.
    * **Non-Coplanar Concurrent:** Lines of action meet at a single point, but the forces are in different planes. (e.g., forces acting at the corner of a room).
    * **Non-Coplanar Parallel:** Lines of action are parallel to each other but lie in different planes. (e.g., forces acting on the legs of a table).
    * **Non-Coplanar Non-Concurrent, Non-Parallel (General Spatial):** Lines of action are not in the same plane, do not meet at a single point, and are not parallel. (Most general case).

### VI. Resolution of a Force

Resolution of a force is the process of breaking down a single force into two or more component forces, usually along specific axes.

#### A. Orthogonal Components of a Force

* **Definition:** Resolving a force into components that are perpendicular to each other, typically along the x and y axes in 2D, or x, y, and z axes in 3D.
* **Method (2D):** If a force $F$ acts at an angle $\theta$ with the positive x-axis:
    * Horizontal Component ($F_x$): $F_x = F \cos \theta$
    * Vertical Component ($F_y$): $F_y = F \sin \theta$
* **Significance:** Simplifies force analysis by allowing independent analysis along each axis. For equilibrium, the sum of components in each direction must be zero.

#### B. Moment of a Force (Torque)

* **Definition:** The turning effect produced by a force about a specific point or axis. It is a measure of the tendency of a force to cause rotation.
* **Unit:** Newton-meter (N·m).
* **Vector Quantity:** Moment is a vector quantity, having both magnitude and direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise, often represented by the right-hand rule for 3D).
* **Magnitude:** $M = F \times d$
    * Where:
        * $F$ = Magnitude of the force.
        * $d$ = Perpendicular distance from the point (about which the moment is taken) to the line of action of the force. This distance is also called the **moment arm**.
* **Direction:** Determined by the direction of rotation the force would cause. Conventionally, counter-clockwise moments are positive, and clockwise moments are negative.

#### C. Varignon's Theorem (Principle of Moments)

* **Statement:** The moment of a force about any point is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments of its components about the same point.
* **Explanation:** This theorem is very useful because it allows us to calculate the moment of a force by first resolving it into components (e.g., $F_x$ and $F_y$) and then summing the moments produced by each component.
* **Mathematical Expression (2D):** If a force $\vec{F}$ with components $F_x$ and $F_y$ acts at point (x, y), and we want the moment about the origin (0,0):
    * $M_O = (F_x \times y) - (F_y \times x)$ (assuming standard sign conventions for x, y, and moment directions)
    * Alternatively, using the perpendicular distance method, it would be $M_O = F \times d$. Varignon's theorem confirms these are equivalent.
* **Significance:** Simplifies moment calculations, especially when the perpendicular distance is difficult to determine directly.

### VII. Composition of Forces (Resultant)

Composition of forces is the process of replacing a system of forces by a single equivalent force that produces the same external effect on the body. This single equivalent force is called the **Resultant**.

#### A. Resultant

* **Definition:** A single force that represents the combined effect of all the forces in a force system. It produces the same translational and rotational effects as the original force system.
* **Determination:** Can be found using graphical methods (law of triangle, parallelogram, polygon) or analytical methods (resolution into components).

#### B. Analytical Method for Determination of Resultant

This method involves resolving all forces into their orthogonal components, summing them up, and then combining the resultant components.

1.  **For Concurrent Coplanar Force System:**
    * **Steps:**
        1.  Resolve each force into its X and Y components.
        2.  Algebraically sum all X-components: $\sum F_x = R_x$
        3.  Algebraically sum all Y-components: $\sum F_y = R_y$
        4.  Magnitude of Resultant ($R$): $R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}$
        5.  Direction of Resultant ($\theta$): $\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{R_y}{R_x} \right)$ (Careful with quadrant for $\theta$).
    * **Application:** Useful for determining the net force acting on a particle.

2.  **For Non-Concurrent Coplanar Force System:**
    * **Steps:**
        1.  Resolve each force into its X and Y components.
        2.  Calculate $\sum F_x = R_x$ and $\sum F_y = R_y$.
        3.  Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant force component: $R = \sqrt{R_x^2 + R_y^2}$ and $\theta = \arctan \left( \frac{R_y}{R_x} \right)$.
        4.  Calculate the algebraic sum of moments of all forces about a convenient point (e.g., the origin): $\sum M_O$.
        5.  The line of action of the resultant force $R$ must pass through a point such that its moment about the chosen point is equal to the sum of the moments of all individual forces. If $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the point to the resultant's line of action: $\sum M_O = R \times d$.
    * **Application:** Used for analysis of rigid bodies where forces can cause both translation and rotation.

3.  **For Parallel Coplanar Force System:**
    * **Steps:**
        1.  Choose a reference axis (e.g., y-axis if forces are vertical).
        2.  Algebraically sum all forces to find the magnitude of the resultant: $R = \sum F$. The direction of $R$ will be parallel to the individual forces.
        3.  Choose a convenient point (origin) for taking moments.
        4.  Calculate the algebraic sum of moments of all forces about that point: $\sum M_O$.
        5.  The line of action of the resultant will be at a distance $\bar{x}$ from the reference point such that: $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum M_O}{R}$.
    * **Application:** Common in beam analysis to find the equivalent single load.

#### C. Graphical Method for Determination of Resultant

These methods use scaling and geometric construction to find the resultant.

1.  **Law of Triangle of Forces:**
    * **Principle:** If two forces acting on a particle are represented in magnitude and direction by the two sides of a triangle taken in order, then their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the third side of the triangle taken in the opposite order.
    * **Application:** For two concurrent forces.

2.  **Law of Parallelogram of Forces:**
    * **Principle:** If two forces acting on a particle are represented in magnitude and direction by the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram drawn from a common point, then their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram drawn from the same common point.
    * **Formula (for magnitude of resultant R of two forces F1, F2 with angle $\alpha$ between them):**
        * $R = \sqrt{F_1^2 + F_2^2 + 2F_1 F_2 \cos \alpha}$
    * **Application:** For two concurrent forces.

3.  **Polygon of Forces:**
    * **Principle:** If a number of concurrent forces acting on a particle are represented in magnitude and direction by the successive sides of a polygon taken in order, then their resultant is represented in magnitude and direction by the closing side of the polygon taken in the opposite order.
    * **Application:** For three or more concurrent forces. If the polygon closes (the last force vector ends at the starting point of the first force vector), then the resultant is zero, and the system is in equilibrium.
