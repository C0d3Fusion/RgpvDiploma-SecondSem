---

## 1. Introduction to Mechanics

- **Mechanics:** Branch of physics dealing with motion and forces acting on bodies.
- **Applied Mechanics:** Application of mechanics to solve practical engineering problems.
- **Statics:** Study of bodies at rest or in equilibrium (no motion).
- **Dynamics:** Study of bodies in motion under forces.

## 2. Fundamental Concepts

| Term             | Meaning                                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Space**        | The three-dimensional region in which objects exist.   |
| **Time**         | Measure of the duration of events.                      |
| **Mass**         | Quantity of matter in a body.                            |
| **Particle**     | Body with negligible dimensions compared to the distances involved. |
| **Flexible Body**| Body that can deform easily under force (e.g., rope).  |
| **Rigid Body**   | Body that does not deform under applied forces.         |

---

## 3. Scalar and Vector Quantities

- **Scalar Quantity:** Only magnitude, no direction (e.g., mass, time, temperature).  
- **Vector Quantity:** Has both magnitude and direction (e.g., force, displacement, velocity).

---

## 4. Units of Measurement (SI Units)

| Quantity       | Fundamental Unit      | Symbol      |
|----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Length         | meter                | m           |
| Mass           | kilogram             | kg          |
| Time           | second               | s           |
| Electric Current | ampere              | A           |
| Temperature    | kelvin               | K           |
| Amount of substance | mole             | mol         |
| Luminous Intensity | candela            | cd          |

- **Derived units:** Formed by combination of fundamental units (e.g., Newton, Joule).

---

## 5. Force

- **Definition:** Force is an interaction that changes or tends to change the state of motion of a body.
- **Unit:** Newton (N)  
- **Representation:**  
  - As a vector, showing magnitude and direction.  
  - By **Bow‚Äôs Notation**:  
    ```
    P (magnitude) / arrow (direction) / line of action
    ```
- **Characteristics of Force:**
  - Magnitude  
  - Direction  
  - Point of application  
  - Line of action

- **Effects of Force:**
  - Change in motion (translation or rotation).  
  - Deformation of the body.

---

## 6. Principle of Transmissibility of Force

- The external effect of a force on a rigid body is the same if the force is applied anywhere along its **line of action**.

---

## 7. Force System and Its Classification

| Type               | Description                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Concurrent forces**   | Forces whose lines of action meet at a point.   |
| **Non-concurrent forces** | Forces acting on a body whose lines of action do not meet at a point. |
| **Parallel forces**      | Forces whose lines of action are parallel.       |
| **Coplanar forces**      | Forces acting in the same plane.                  |

---

## 8. Resolution of a Force

- **Resolving a force:** Breaking a force into components acting along specified directions (usually perpendicular axes).
  
### Orthogonal Components of a Force

- A force **F** acting at an angle **Œ∏** can be resolved into:

```
F_x = F √ó cosŒ∏   (horizontal component)
F_y = F √ó sinŒ∏   (vertical component)
```

---

## 9. Moment of a Force

- **Moment (torque):** Tendency of a force to rotate a body about a point or axis.
- **Formula:**

```
M = F √ó d
```
Where,  
- M = moment of force (Nm)  
- F = magnitude of force (N)  
- d = perpendicular distance from the point/axis to the line of action of force (m)

---

## 10. Varignon‚Äôs Theorem

- The moment of a force about a point is equal to the algebraic sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same point.

---

## 11. Composition of Forces

- **Resultant:** Single force which has the same effect as all forces acting together.
  
### Analytical Method for Resultant:

- For forces acting at a point (concurrent forces):

If forces **F‚ÇÅ, F‚ÇÇ, ..., F‚Çô** act at a point making angles **Œ∏‚ÇÅ, Œ∏‚ÇÇ, ..., Œ∏‚Çô** with x-axis,

```
R_x = Œ£ F_i √ó cos Œ∏_i
R_y = Œ£ F_i √ó sin Œ∏_i
```

Resultant magnitude:

```
R = ‚àö(R_x¬≤ + R_y¬≤)
```

Resultant direction:

```
Œ∏ = tan‚Åª¬π (R_y / R_x)
```

## 12. Laws of Forces for Graphical Methods

| Law                 | Description                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Law of Triangle of Forces** | If two forces act at a point, their resultant is represented by the third side of the triangle formed by the two forces as two sides. |
| **Law of Parallelogram of Forces** | If two forces acting simultaneously on a point are represented in magnitude and direction by two adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then their resultant is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram. |
| **Polygon of Forces** | For more than two forces acting at a point, forces can be represented by sides of a polygon taken in order, and the closing side of the polygon represents the resultant force. |

---

## ‚úÖ Exam Tips:

- Understand the vector nature of force and ability to resolve it.
- Practice graphical methods and analytical calculation of resultants.
- Remember to apply Varignon‚Äôs theorem to simplify moment calculations.
- Practice problems on moment, resolution, and composition of forces.
- Be comfortable drawing and interpreting force diagrams.
