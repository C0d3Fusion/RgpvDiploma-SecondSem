# ðŸ“˜ UNIT II: Equilibrium

---

## 1. Equilibrium and Equilibrant

- **Equilibrium:** A body is in equilibrium when it is at rest or moves with constant velocity (no acceleration).  
- **Condition of Equilibrium:**  
  - The resultant force on the body is zero.  
  - The resultant moment about any point is zero.

- **Equilibrant:** A single force which, when applied to a body, brings it into equilibrium by balancing all the forces acting on it.  
  It is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the resultant force.

---

## 2. Free Body and Free Body Diagram (FBD)

- **Free Body:** The body isolated from its surroundings to analyze forces acting on it.  
- **Free Body Diagram:** A simplified sketch showing the body and all external forces and moments acting on it, including supports and reactions.

---

## 3. Analytical and Graphical Methods of Analyzing Equilibrium

- **Analytical Method:** Uses algebra and equations (sum of forces and moments) to find unknown forces.  
- **Graphical Method:** Uses vector diagrams and geometrical constructions (like polygons of forces) to determine resultant and equilibrium.

---

## 4. Lamiâ€™s Theorem

### Statement:
If three forces acting at a point keep the body in equilibrium, then each force is proportional to the sine of the angle between the other two forces.

### Mathematical Form:

If three forces **P**, **Q**, and **R** act at a point and are in equilibrium making angles Î±, Î², and Î³ opposite to each force respectively, then:

```
P / sin Î± = Q / sin Î² = R / sin Î³
```

### Application:
- Used for solving problems involving three concurrent, coplanar forces in equilibrium.

## 5. Types of Beams and Supports

| Beam Type         | Description                                  |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Cantilever Beam** | Fixed at one end, free at the other.         |
| **Simply Supported Beam** | Supported at both ends, free to rotate but no horizontal movement. |
| **Overhanging Beam** | Extends beyond its support on one or both ends. |

| Support Type       | Description                                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Simple Support** | Allows rotation, resists vertical force only.|
| **Hinged Support** | Allows rotation, resists vertical and horizontal forces. |
| **Roller Support** | Allows rotation and horizontal movement, resists vertical force only. |
| **Fixed Support**  | Prevents rotation and translation, resists all forces and moments.|

## 6. Loads Acting on Beams

| Load Type                   | Description                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Vertical Point Load**      | Force applied at a single point vertically downwards or upwards. |
| **Inclined Point Load**      | Force applied at an angle to the beam. |
| **Uniformly Distributed Load (UDL)** | Load spread evenly over a length of the beam. |
| **Couple**                  | Pair of equal and opposite forces creating a moment but no resultant force.|

---

## 7. Beam Reactions

### For Cantilever Beam:

- Reaction forces act at the fixed support.  
- It can have vertical reaction force **R**, horizontal reaction force **H**, and moment **M**.

---

### For Simply Supported Beam (with or without overhang):

- Reactions occur at supports (usually two supports).  
- Vertical reactions are calculated based on applied loads.

---

### Loads Considered:

- Combination of vertical point load and uniformly distributed load.

---

## 8. Analytical Calculation of Reactions

- **Sum of vertical forces = 0:**  
  ```
  Î£F_y = 0
  ```

- **Sum of horizontal forces = 0 (if any):**  
  ```
  Î£F_x = 0
  ```

- **Sum of moments about a point = 0:**  
  ```
  Î£M = 0
  ```

Use these equations to solve for unknown reactions.

---

## 9. Graphical Determination of Reactions for Simply Supported Beam

- Applicable for vertical point loads only.  
- Use **funicular polygon** or **graphic statics** methods to find reactions visually.  
- Steps include drawing the beam to scale, representing loads as vectors, and constructing polygons of forces.

## âœ… Exam Tips:

- Understand the difference between equilibrium and equilibrant clearly.  
- Practice drawing Free Body Diagrams for different beams.  
- Memorize Lamiâ€™s theorem formula and know when to apply it.  
- Be familiar with types of beams, supports, and their reactions.  
- Practice reaction calculation both analytically and graphically for simple cases.  
- Draw neat, labeled diagrams in exams for clarity.
