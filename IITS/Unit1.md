This unit provides foundational knowledge for navigating the digital world, focusing on essential internet usage and understanding the physical components of a computer.

### I. Basic Internet Skills

The internet is a vast global network of interconnected computer networks that communicate using standardized protocols. Basic internet skills are crucial for accessing information, communicating, and interacting with various online services.

#### A. Understanding Browser

* **Definition:** A web browser is a software application used to access and view content on the World Wide Web. It interprets and displays web pages, allowing users to interact with text, images, videos, and other digital content.
* **Key Functions of a Browser:**
    * **Displaying Web Pages:** Renders HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies into a human-readable format.
    * **Navigation:**
        * **Address Bar (URL bar):** Where you type website addresses (URLs) to go to a specific page.
        * **Back/Forward Buttons:** To navigate between previously visited pages.
        * **Refresh/Reload Button:** To update the current page.
        * **Home Button:** To go to your designated homepage.
    * **Tabs:** Allows users to open and switch between multiple web pages within a single browser window.
    * **Bookmarks/Favorites:** A feature to save links to frequently visited websites for quick access.
    * **History:** Records a list of recently visited websites.
    * **Downloads:** Manages files downloaded from the internet.
    * **Settings/Preferences:** Allows users to customize browser behavior, privacy settings, security features, and appearance.
    * **Extensions/Add-ons:** Small software programs that add new features or modify the functionality of the browser.

* **Popular Web Browsers:** Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Apple Safari, Opera.

#### B. Efficient Use of Search Engines

* **Definition:** A search engine is a software system designed to carry out web searches, which means to search the World Wide Web in a systematic way for particular information specified in a textual web search query.
* **How Search Engines Work (Simplified):**
    1.  **Crawling:** Bots (spiders) crawl the web, following links and discovering new web pages.
    2.  **Indexing:** The content of these pages is analyzed, categorized, and stored in a massive database (index).
    3.  **Ranking:** When a user enters a query, the search engine retrieves relevant pages from its index and ranks them based on various algorithms (e.g., relevance, authority, freshness) to present the most useful results first.
* **Tips for Efficient Searching:**
    * **Use Specific Keywords:** Instead of "cars," try "best electric cars 2025."
    * **Use Quotation Marks for Exact Phrases:** `"digital India portal"` will search for that exact phrase.
    * **Use Minus Sign to Exclude Terms:** `apple -fruit` to search for the company, not the fruit.
    * **Use "site:" to Search Within a Specific Website:** `site:gov.in "aadhaar"` to search for Aadhaar information only on government of India websites.
    * **Use "filetype:" to Search for Specific File Types:** `filetype:pdf "university syllabus"`
    * **Use "OR" for Alternatives:** `colleges OR universities`
    * **Use Asterisk (*) as a Wildcard:** `how to * a computer`
    * **Look for Reputable Sources:** Prioritize `.gov`, `.edu`, and well-known organizational websites for reliable information.
    * **Understand Search Operators:** Familiarize yourself with advanced search operators for more refined results.
* **Popular Search Engines:** Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yahoo Search.

### II. General Understanding of Various Computer Hardware Components

Computer hardware refers to the physical components that constitute a computer system. Understanding these components is essential to grasp how a computer functions.

#### A. CPU (Central Processing Unit)

* **Analogy:** Often called the "brain" of the computer.
* **Function:** Executes instructions, performs calculations, and manages the flow of data through the entire computer system. It is responsible for carrying out most of the processing.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Cores:** The number of independent processing units (e.g., dual-core, quad-core). More cores allow for better multitasking.
    * **Clock Speed:** Measured in Gigahertz (GHz), indicates how many cycles per second the CPU can perform. Higher clock speed generally means faster processing.
    * **Cache Memory:** Small, very fast memory integrated into the CPU to store frequently accessed data for quicker retrieval.
* **Manufacturers:** Intel (Core i3/i5/i7/i9, Xeon), AMD (Ryzen, Threadripper, EPYC).

#### B. Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory)

* **Definition:** Volatile memory that stores data and program instructions that the CPU is actively using. It's "random access" because any byte of memory can be accessed directly without going through preceding bytes.
* **Function:** Provides temporary storage for running applications and data, allowing the CPU fast access to information it needs right now. When the computer is turned off, data in RAM is lost.
* **Characteristics:**
    * **Capacity:** Measured in Gigabytes (GB) (e.g., 8GB, 16GB, 32GB). More RAM allows for more applications to run simultaneously and handle larger files.
    * **Speed:** Measured in MHz or MT/s (MegaTransfers per second), affecting how quickly data can be accessed.
* **Types:** DDR4, DDR5 (current common standards).

#### C. Display (Monitor)

* **Definition:** An output device that visually presents information processed by the computer.
* **Function:** Displays text, images, videos, and graphical user interfaces to the user.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Screen Size:** Measured diagonally in inches.
    * **Resolution:** The number of pixels (horizontal x vertical) displayed (e.g., 1920x1080 for Full HD, 3840x2160 for 4K). Higher resolution means sharper images.
    * **Aspect Ratio:** The ratio of width to height (e.g., 16:9 widescreen).
    * **Refresh Rate:** How many times the screen updates per second (Hz). Higher refresh rates (e.g., 120Hz, 144Hz) provide smoother motion.
    * **Panel Type:** LCD (Liquid Crystal Display), LED (Light Emitting Diode - a type of LCD with LED backlighting), OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode - offers superior contrast and color).
* **Graphics Card/GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):** A specialized processor that renders images, animations, and videos for display on the monitor. Integrated GPUs are part of the CPU, while dedicated GPUs are separate cards for high-performance graphics.

#### D. Keyboard

* **Definition:** An input device consisting of a set of keys, similar to a typewriter, used to enter text, numbers, and commands into a computer.
* **Function:** Primary means of textual input and issuing commands.
* **Types:** QWERTY (most common layout), ergonomic, mechanical, wireless.

#### E. Mouse

* **Definition:** A pointing input device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface.
* **Function:** Used to control a cursor (pointer) on the screen, select items, click buttons, drag and drop, and navigate graphical user interfaces.
* **Types:** Optical, laser, trackball, wireless.

#### F. HDD (Hard Disk Drive)

* **Definition:** A non-volatile storage device that stores digital data using rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material.
* **Function:** Used for long-term storage of operating systems, applications, and user files. Data persists even when the computer is turned off.
* **Key Characteristics:**
    * **Capacity:** Measured in Gigabytes (GB) or Terabytes (TB) (e.g., 500GB, 1TB, 4TB).
    * **Speed:** Measured by RPM (rotations per minute) and data transfer rates.
* **Comparison with SSD (Solid State Drive):** SSDs are a newer, faster non-volatile storage technology that use flash memory. They are more expensive but offer significantly faster boot times and application loading. Many modern computers use SSDs as their primary storage.

#### G. Other Peripheral Devices

* **Definition:** Any external device that connects to a computer to expand its functionality.
